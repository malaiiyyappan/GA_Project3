I am in the last year of my PhD and are getting together applications to some research/post-doc positions. My pre-doctoral background is a BA in Journalism and an MA in Communication and Media Studies, while my current programme is awarded as a 'PhD in Social Sciences' by my institution. I would say that during my BA/MA studies I have engaged with a wide range of theories and methods from across the social sciences, while my doctoral research is firmly within the remit of sociology, and heavily engages with theory  from sociology of media/culture in particular (Frankfurt School etc); my supervisor is also active in that area. Naturally, a lot of interesting work relating to my research is going on in sociology as well as media/journalism departments so I would aspire to apply to both of those, though I tend to find sociology departments more interesting due to their potential for more breadth.  


However, I have been baffled by whether my background 'entitles' me to call myself a sociologist on CVs and relevant applications and/or whether not doing so could harm my chances of getting hired for not seeming oriented enough toward the discipline; my supervisor reassures me that it would be appropriate but I am weary that some (most?) sociology departments may scoff at the idea of somebody presenting themselves as a sociologist without a 'pure' sociology background at the BA/MA level or indeed with a PhD bearing the exact same title. Despite having a couple of publication on sociology-oriented journals under my belt I would not like to overstep or claim anything deemed too offensive in broader disciplinary circles.

I'm building an open source [4X Game](https://github.com/loic-prieto/4xframework) (actually a framework to build 4X Games) on my free time and as I'm approaching the design stage, I'm focusing on the growth model for the population in cities. There's much to be said about a simple model (realistic vs fun, etc), but since I suspect I'm the only user of that framework, I much prefer a realistic approach.

I've been reading some articles in the wikipedia and other places about constraints on human population due to health conditions, access to food, child mortality, diseases, maternal mortality, economic conditions, education levels, etc but it hasn't been easy  to find information outside of the current era.

For example, one recurring doubt I have is: How much population can a city support before there are more deaths than births. Could roman cities have supported 10M people in the same city? No doubt there's a limit on how much a country can grow (or import) food  and basic supplies before there's not enough food for everyone. Or sanitation levels that have to exist before a 1M people inside a city can avoid becoming cesspools of diseases and contagions that wipe out the population.

Could someone provide me with books references and/or links that I could read to get basic information on how the human population grows over the different eras an due to which factors, so that I could model them (while also providing a fun experience xD) into the framework (and also because the topic is very interesting)?

Quick question about Butler's critique of De Beauvoir, that she assumes that there is something intrinsic to being a woman, whereas Butler believes that gender is not a manifestation of intrinsic patterns but instead a set of patterns and behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

Does De Beauvoir ever state that there is something to being a woman? I understand that she says that women have been othered by men, and that men repress them through this characterisation, but when I read the text I was interpreting that as meaning that being a woman is acting as you were taught from a young age. At the very least I didn't think she stated if there was something intrinsic to gender.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be a bit easier if I&amp;#39;m trying to do economic sociology, but I think I&amp;#39;m more interested in more theoretical issues of stratification which econ completely fails to take into account. Of course I have some quant skills that I can sell, but I&amp;#39;d really prefer not to do quant-heavy research just because it&amp;#39;s safer / more in demand (what are your thoughts on this btw?). I&amp;#39;m gonna have to read more &amp;amp; do more research on the field in general for sure. I&amp;#39;m just worried bc when I look at profiles of sociology grad students most of them seem to be ones that were already doing well in the field before PhD.. And I definitely can&amp;#39;t afford master&amp;#39;s :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I teach myself core concepts &amp;amp; current trends in sociology over the next few months and write up a decent statement based on that, will I stand some chance? I&amp;#39;ve got a good GPA from a liberal arts college and 170(V)/169(Q)/5(W) in GRE, although my recommendation letters might be kinda mediocre. If I apply, what would be the things I should focus on? Are there any readings you would recommend to get myself up-to-date quickly? Sorry for the bombardment of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be much appreciated!!&lt;/p&gt;

However, his own writing on this gives a far more detailed picture (see his defence from Sep 2018 [here](https://medium.com/@NoahCarl/some-comments-on-the-rationalwiki-page-about-me-e889d98bb165?fbclid=IwAR2-wAG3riUfMh1EZIELKj0lKPdbtU0oAdSGg_6iwVpOC1_37N39WBNZxlQ) and an FAQ from earlier today [here](https://medium.com/@NoahCarl/noah-carl-controversy-faq-ad967834b12d?fbclid=IwAR1sjR4jIB9a5xbCxTT7QVy9oQKUh0ItT6gvntFO8gBrNKLo6QxWoxfA7kU)). You can also find a collection of his published material on Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CUywRJoAAAAJ).

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, though, I have two central questions with which I'm grappling: is Noah Carl ethical and is his work scientific? The latter strongly relies on the former, but I don't have the technical knowledge to critique his sophistication as an academic within his field or the validity of his field.

&amp;#x200B;

He's clearly working in a taboo area, but I, as an anti-theist, an opponent of the drug war, a frequent progressive, and a general rationalist, am disinclined to trust the crowd. Also, I've found his defence to be strong, partly because it coincides with many of my own beliefs about the practicality and ethicality of truth. His arguments in [*How Stifling Debate Around Race, Genes and IQ Can Do Harm*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40806-018-0152-x.pdf), which appears to be central to this issue, are that studying taboo areas has not been proved to cause harm (if you read the philosophical and scientific literature that preceded and assisted Nazism you're not going to find much resembling Carl's writing) and suppression of science and knowledge is harmful. Could anyone propound, explicate, and defend their conclusions here? I would like to hear any arguments from any side of the fence.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the status of his work as scientific, he links to [a paper](https://www.openpsych.net/paper/48) of his on the accuracy of ""casual stereotypes"" in Britain, a [critique of the paper](http://www.healthgeomatics.com/award-winner-in-dumb-research/), and [his response](https://openpsych.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=292&amp;pid=4388#pid4388) to that critique, in his FAQ from earlier today. Is there anyone with relevant expertise, experience, or knowledge willing and able to weigh in on the quality of his work? Again, his body of work is linked above, and much of it you can read in full for free.

&amp;#x200B;

There are four significant possibilities here: he's moral and he's a good scientist, he's moral and he's a bad scientist, he's immoral and he's a good scientist, or he's immoral and he's a bad scientist. For an academic, is it immoral to work with dubious figures like Emil Kirkegaard, is it immoral to publish material in alternative journals run by people like Emil Kirkegaard, is it immoral to study this area, and is Carl a good scientist? I'm dying to understand this, and I'd really appreciate any intelligent engagement on the topic. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please help.

**Sociology challenge #1 recap**  
[When asked to define structure](https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/bl0apf/sociology_challenge_explain_structure_without/), we see both and ease and complexity arise. Sure, the foundation from which social action and society arise – whether that be networks or stable patterns of action. Non-random you say? Actually established definitions? If that is so, then hold the presses, stop all theory, we’re done here. Or would you say there’s more than only habitual actions? Or is structure more like grammar to our speech?  
 

/u/muscadine76 reaps in the most karma with their definition: “Social structure is the set of relationships between social institutions and among large social groups that shape and regulate interactions between individuals and organizations within that society.”   
 However, does it mean that the most karma is also the best definition? /u/ADBuck elaborates on this definition using Levi Martin’s work: adding the relation between persons and organization – a clear insight from the bursting field of network sociology – exciting!  
 /u/Bomphy challenges this definition by problematizing the use of interaction, because… what is an interaction exactly?  
 

/u/sirianjazz (Syrian jazz? Do share!) points towards the institutionalization of patterns into rigid frameworks. Very *social construction of reality*, very Berger and Luckmann. Love the definition, but where do these patterns spring from, and what can we make of the process of adoption by a group? Is this a conflict- or consensus- definition? Intriguing. 

/u/novelANDsignificant (don’t we all wish we were both novel and significant?) points to the rhetorical force of ‘structure’, and in a very Sewellian fashion calls out both its enabling and constraining features. My personal fave. However, it raises the very architectural question: how is that structure constructed?  
 

Isn’t thinking fun? Are y’all ready for the next challenge? ‘Cause I’m thinking to make this a more formal relationship 😉

Hi,

I don't know how many of you are interested in Brazil, but many of our colleagues are Brazilianists and American academic institutions work hand in hand with Brazilian ones. Last Friday, president Bolsonaro and Minister of Education Abraham Weintraub announced that they plan to ""decentralize"" resources to social sciences and humanities, particularly targeting sociology and philosophy. This week they decided to cut 30% of all federal universities' budget. This is the beginning of the end of academia in the fourth largest democracy in the world, starting with the social sciences and humanities.

A colleague and I have written this open letter from U.S. and global sociologists in support of  Brazilian sociology. In less than 5 days, over 6000 academics across the globe, from all continents and over 1500 different academic institutions have signed the letter. The president of the International Sociological Association has signed, and so have the presidents of many national associations (including Australia, Greece, and Israel). Please join us in our fight for our Brazilian colleagues. We need to mobilize. Brazil is quickly becoming one of the largest fascist regimes in history. 

In solidarity.

I was wondering if anybody had any ideas for books - also articles is okay, but hopefully books - on how different cultures approach these different  topics: parenting, home life, emotional development, and in  general, how people think about gender.

For  example, I was recently reading this NPR article about how anger is  really frowned upon in Inuit society and the parenting techniques that  are used to dissuade kids from indulging anger and temper tantrums: [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/685533353/a-playful-way-to-teach-kids-to-control-their-anger](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/685533353/a-playful-way-to-teach-kids-to-control-their-anger)

I  had also read this NPR article about how Central American children are  taught to enjoy and not resent chores quite as much (sorry if I am  generalizing based on one article, I don't mean that all Central  American children feel this way, I'm just more interested in how there  are different parenting techniques out there in this big great world of  ours). [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/09/616928895/how-to-get-your-kids-to-do-chores-without-resenting-it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/09/616928895/how-to-get-your-kids-to-do-chores-without-resenting-it)

I've also read a bunch on Dutch topics of Hygge and Gezelligheid.

I know that there are a ton of books about parenting in France.

In  the book ""Revolutionary Mothers,"" by the famed historian Carol Berkin,  she goes into the gender concepts of many different groups of women  during the American revolutionary war/colonial period, including  Iroquois and other native American groups. In addition to her work, I've  read others that go a bit more into detail on how Iroquois gender roles  seemed so different to the European settlers.

I'm interested in how things like the ""Jante Law"" influences happiness, family, and home life in Nordic countries: [https://qz.com/794740/the-happiness-of-the-danes-can-easily-be-explained-by-10-cultural-rules/](https://qz.com/794740/the-happiness-of-the-danes-can-easily-be-explained-by-10-cultural-rules/)

I am Jewish and know a bit about how gender and parenting is thought about in my own religion, but not so much in other religions, so would be interested in learning!

I  know I mainly posted links to articles and alluded to the existence of  some other books and ideas floating out there, but I would really like  to just compile an actual reading list of books. I love having hardcopy, non-digital books to hold in my hand and read at night, so I'm looking  into some books on these topics that I can order more so than for  articles - although I'm happy to read more articles too.

I  hope this hasn't caused offense to anyone, I'm sorry if I haven't  worded this correctly and welcome feedback about better ways to pose my  question. This is just something I love reading about and  would love to learn more about.

Thanks for any help!

Our theoretical starting point is networks and their influence on the engagement for others. The problem is that there is soooo much that has been written on the topic, I'm a bit lost. We were supposed to do a small, focused litterature review to frame our project but it was messy due to the amount of reading that was needed.

I was assigned a final paper and the prompt states: Choose a substantive issue that is dealt with in significant measure in classical and contemporary social theory, provide a historical review of the treatment of the topic, example: Charismatic Leadership (Weber) Fashion (Simmel) 

I wanted to take a different approach and was hoping some of you fine sociologists could let me know if I’m straying to far from the question. 


I decided when writing my paper I wanted to take a broader approach to the topic. I was hoping you could let me know if im to far off in my thinking. 

As i begun to outline my paper I wanted to focus it on:

“The ever-changing methodological and ideological approach to sociology itself”
 
What i have begun drafing revolved around three main points as i found myself bouncing around far to much. 

·   How sociology was researched
o   Then vs. Now

·   Evolution, adaptation, and alteration of theories and ideological premises
o   Then vs. Now

·   Specific Examples: Marxism, Freud, Etc.
o   Then vs. Now 

Do you think this is an acceptable topic? I was able to construct a rough-rough draft (if you will) and I really think it could work. However, i do realize this is VERY broad and doesn't focus on any singular issue. My thinking was that Sociology was studied far different in circa 1940 both methodoligcally and ideally, then it is today. People have taken bits and pieces of Marx/Hommins/Freud and formed their opinons based on what best fits THIER ideology. I found intresting articles on how Marxists today are no where near what Marxists in the 1900s were like. I found writings on how the idea and definitions of “Theory itself” has changed meanings over time and things like this were what lead me to want to chose the disicipline and approach of sociology itself as my social theory. 

Am i completley off base here?

I apologize if this post is a bit redundant, as I can imagine these sort of questions pop up a lot.  In the past, I applied and was accepted into an Econ PhD at a Top 30 school. Due to some challenging personal circumstances, I chose to leave after my comp exams after a very difficult year in the program. At only 20 years old and in the circumstances I was in, I wasn't ready to excel in a PhD.

Four years later, I'd really like to finish what I started, and my professional/research experience over the years has given me the clarity to steer away from Economics and towards Sociology. I'm more familiar with Econ admissions than Sociology and was looking for some guidance as to what Sociology programs are looking for, generally speaking. I understand that fit is a top priority, and I will be taking that into account when deciding where to apply. I think I can provide the necessary context behind my Econ PhD experience in an addendum, but I was curious how my profile may look on first glance.

&amp;#x200B;

BS Econ/Math - 3.9 GPA (highly quantitative background)

MA Econ - 3.0 GPA (This was a Top 30 PhD program. I did pass my Micro and Econometrics comps on my first go and was welcomed back to take Macro again in the fall, but I declined.)

MPA - 3.9 GPA (Top 20)

GRE - 167Q, 165V, 5.5W (Taken in 2015 so will still be valid for next application cycle. Thinking about retaking because I believe 170Q is absolutely possible, maybe 170V. This probably isn't necessary, but it would be a pretty light lift for me to close some of those gaps from the first time I took the exam).

Work experience - Currently work in external affairs for one of the largest and highest performing charter networks in the US. Past relevant experience doing policy research for a nonprofit advocating on behalf of Child Protective Services. While in school, I was an Econ TA.

Writing Sample - I expect to polish off my undergraduate thesis on knowledge of labor returns and the college major choice. I'm interested in how information asymmetries perpetuate inequality, so this seems like a strong connection with what I expect to write in a personal statement.

I need to choose a major by fall as I&amp;#39;m going to be signing agreements with different campuses. I got a 97% in my sociology 1 course which is the highest grade I&amp;#39;ve earned so far in my college career. This is leading me to think sociology would be the best method for success. I don&amp;#39;t really care about making a lot of money as long as I&amp;#39;m happy with what I&amp;#39;m doing in my career. I&amp;#39;m also 99% sure I&amp;#39;m going to do grad school as well so I need to take that into consideration as well in picking a major. I know this is largely my decision, but i&amp;#39;d like to hear some differing opinions on choosing this major and the most common careers it may lead to. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I work mostly on subjects that most people would consider intimate; i.e. religion and sexuality (I'd like to specify that I live in France, where religion is regarded as a much more private matter than it is in the English-speaking world). I am happy to talk about my research with anyone interested, but I'm really at my wit's end regarding the number of people who, upon learning abo my research, feel entitled to ask me questions about my personal life. Thankfully, people rarely ask about my sex life (though it does happen!) but I'm really tired that I can't talk about what I do in life in any context without immediately being asked if I believe in God/pray/whether my parents are religious. 

For instance, I was recently doing fieldwork in a Jewish community, and I was asked at least ten times (not on my fieldwork, but by other people): ""Are you doing this because you are Jewish, or because you find the subject interesting?"" Thing is, I'm Jewish, but I chose Judaism for several reasons that had strictly nothing to do with my identity and as soon as I disclose my Jewishness, the questions get less academic and more personal (sometimes downright intimate about things I don't feel comfortable answering), as if I can't have actual academic reasons for being interested in Judaism and it must all be related to my personal life. 

I've tried several strategies. Being extremely vague about my research subjects, which sometimes works, except it makes me a pretty bad conversationalist. Straight-up refusing to answer questions I deem too personal, which works too except it makes me appear cold and people (understandably) are less eager to talk to me. 

I just want to be able to talk about subjects I'm passionate about, and have normal conversations during parties, without suddenly having people feel entitled to ask me personal questions. I know it might seem kind of a frivolous concern, but just to be clear, I don't mind an overly personal question once in a while, the problem is accumulation: it's happened to me about fifty times to have normal conversations turn into very intimate and uncomfortable ones. 

Has anyone had to deal with that kind of stuff? Do you have any scripts to talk about what you do in life during social occasions without it getting weird?

I&amp;#39;ve read the chapters over and over but i&amp;#39;m still not understanding the numbers and equations or even what to do. My school doesn&amp;#39;t have tutoring for it. I have a final writing assignment due in May that i&amp;#39;m wanting to work on now. It is based on some data that our professor set up for us but i&amp;#39;m very lost.  I&amp;#39;ve done great with everything else on the course except the advanced mathematical things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any sites or tips to make it more understandable?  Would I absolutely have to use these numbers and equations if I pursued a career in sociology? &lt;/p&gt;

I was reading a snippet from the wealth of nations and came across this bit.

""The general industry of the society never can exceed what the capital of the society can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in employment by any particular person must bear a certain proportion to his capital, so the number of those that can be continually employed by all the members of a great society, must bear a certain proportion to the whole capital of that society, and never can exceed that proportion.""

I'm don't really know what he means by capital and industry. I'm assuming he means financial capital and labor. Any clarification would be appreciated. Because different kinds of labor happens to be valued differently. Does this bit just consider the least valued labor and say that there's a limit?

Later he states the following.

""If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished, no more than that of the above-mentioned artificers; but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage. ""

Because different kinds of labor is valued differently, isn't there the possibility that the advantageous form of industry could be one that is disproportionately valued thus reducing industry? 

This stems from my assumption that different forms of labor can be overvalued or undervalued? Does he perhaps consider that assumption to be false?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the final stages of a yearlong community strategy project I've been developing for an educational nonprofit I work for. I can't believe how useful my degree in Sociology has been, especially in the more nuanced ""Theory of Change"" proposal using a Communities of Practice framework (which I began to develop in grad school!) which I built our whole 3-year strategy off of. So far, everyone has been impressed by the level of depth I've been able to go - which is largely because of my training and studies in Sociology.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't expect that to be the case since I've spent the last decade in career of teacher education development. However, it's because of this more integrative, ""objective, nonjudgemental"" lens I've developed through Sociology that has allowed me to step away from current constraints or solutions to complex problems in education, to really boil it all down to the fundamentals of what humans need to thrive: happiness, agency, community/connection, structure without oppression, and self-expression. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a Sociologist, you learn to see more of the fabric of how our societal rules/structures have been woven together, and even sometimes the deeper intentions that are sometimes (usually) oppressive. Things like  essentializing culture, inflating social categories or giving unequal power to socially designed communities like gov'ts, churches, schools, social movements, etc... these are all things we as Sociologists can look carefully at, and begin to undo some of the older, less ""pro-social"" intentions of why we gather, what we collectively value and how we take care of each other (even when we have differing opinions).

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who are studying Sociology or considering what careers beyond the degree could look like - just know that our training is very applicable in many domains. Sociologists can enter many different doors to help solve the problems our society faces on both micro and macro levels, as long as you keep the frame simple and objective. There is especially a surge in the ""Community Manager"" role, which suits Sociologist's training well (and has decent pay!). 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started my path as a Sociologist, I had no idea what to expect or what career I'd fall into. I figured I'd end up in academia because I didn't know what kind of job I could get as a Sociologist otherwise. All I knew was that every concept was so fascinating and contextualized my whole life experience in a very practical lens. I connected to this way of understanding people (through groups and our shared experiences) moreso than through my study of Psychology. My dad was pretty upset when I told him I was not going to be pursuing my Clinical Psychology degree, and was transitioning to Sociology (""from barely applied to even less applied!"", he said as a Chemical Engineer). But I just trusted my interest because it felt insatiable. While I'm still paying off my student loans, I'm very grateful I became a Sociologist. While I've needed to get creative along the way, all roads seem to lead back to Sociology for me.

What are some of the worst/best/most cringeworthy things you’ve heard uttered at a sociology conference or on a panel?

I’ll provide one to start:

Once went to a panel on immigration and crime and basically his whole premise was that there is implicit racial bias in the CJ and immigration system in how we view immigrants. One panelist was asked a question after he finished his presentation about his lack of representation of the Asian immigrants in his sample of the CJ system.  Basically I think he was wanting the presenter to elaborate on how this might be a way in which the model minority myth is playing out.  
The presenter turned to the guy next to him and said “well you’re Asian. Why don’t YOU answer this question.’ 

The guy looks at him dead in the face and says: “I’m from Washington.”

Someone from the askphilosophy sub kindly directed me here and a few other subs as being more appropriate.

***Preface to question***\*: I just got attacked pretty bad on a spiritual sub for using terms like ""group think and the masses"". I have zero emotions behind those terms and happily admit that I too am a victim of thoughts lying dormant in my subconscious that have been placed there by society that I am trying everyday to be aware of and gently root out. A lot of my thoughts are not my own, how could they be? I have to post this under a throwaway acc due to the trolling so I am just going to preface this post to avoid the same problems by explaining the ways that I use and understand those terms;

*""In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind”.*

*Edward Bernays*

**Question:**

**Does anyone have any pointers in terms of literature as to what maybe a good starting ground for me as a newbie to social sciences to develop a good intellectual understanding of how and why human beings operate in groups and how someone who is ostracized for not confirming can use that knowledge to accept that being ostracized is inevitable, maybe?**

Okay so that is a really general question with a lot of generalizations but I wanted to do that for now. The context below is possibly to help anyone who has any pointers in terms of what type of literature is helpful. *Answers I have got before are ""why do you care?"", ""the problem is you""?, ""thinking of people in group terms isn't helpful"". I understand, I really do but if this is a response you have and no other suggestions in further reading then this isn't helpful to me right now.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:** *Reference only, no need to reply to or base any potential feedback on.*

I have a very solid strength of character when it comes to staying 100% true to good values and practicing them. I can withstand groups of people hostility and have done it before with resilience. However, I notice that as some of my values contradict the social norms of the society I live in (for example, I remove myself immediately and do so with not with an ounce of toxic energy from workplace gossiping especially if it's done maliciously and this has caused me in the past to be aggressively targeted at previous workplaces for not fitting in by gossiping or tolerating it by sitting with people who gossip and this has led to sabotage of my work and affected my job stability at my previous job). The work example is a great one because it wasn't that I cared about being ostracized from the group because I needed social validation, I was just confused internally because I just had no idea why I was being attacked and being clueless caused a bit of stress (nothing I couldn't handle) on the inside but on the outside I remained strong and unwavering in not breaking. I live in my own bubble. I had no idea how groups of entire colleagues can be upset with someone for not sitting with them to gossip. This is not a judgement, I am seriously clueless. How is that offensive? My assumption is that because people in groups don't like it when others choose their own path but I get how this generalizations can cause offence and it's only an assumption. I'd feel more confident in understanding these dynamics if I read more deeply into academic literature on the study of human history and group behavior and  so I can navigate these issues with better ease and wisdom because this is only one example of some other conflicts I encounter but its the best one for this post.

I feel if I am better able to intellectually grasp how humans behave in groups when someone does not conform to their social norm then I can develop more ease and wisdom in not allowing those feelings in my old workplace to show up (like self doubt and stress which was caused by being clueless as to why I was being attacked). I am someone that really thrives in my own company and believe I am adding good by holding onto core values that are based on integrity. I know I can withstand the entire world if they turned on me for not forfeiting good values but I believe it would benefit me to understand the conflicts that will inevitable arise by staying true to myself and understand why the conflict  occurs from a critical and academic lens free from my own biases so it can help me learn to be free from the inner dialogue caused by confusion and practice both patience with my fellow humans and develop wisdom when confronting conflicts.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I transferred from community college to a top university and never really learned a lot of the cultural capital that goes into navigating these situations (1st generation college student that nearly threw my life away on drugs, 5+ years clean now, graduating in May).

i am an undergraduate student graduating in may with a BA in sociology and anthropology. i'm 22 years old.

though i am eternally grateful for my education and involvement with this discipline, i feel disillusioned, alienated, and hopeless. not only do i always feel like a participant observer in my own life, my perspective on history, culture, and society have drawn me to the conclusion that all of my knowledge is for nothing. we read the works of all these great thinkers who had visions of how to change the world (some even had actual plans!) but then we look around at the world we live in and see that not only has nothing changed, but often times that now it's even worse.

i think the internet is a fucking mistake. i think we're all going to die in the irreversible climate catastrophe that is coming in twelve years. i think it doesn't fucking matter who i've read and what i know, because no one with power will ever, ever listen to me, and i will never have the power to make any real change. i think we've been sentenced to death by people who died decades or maybe centuries before we were even born, and now all we can do is wait to meet our fates. capitalism and its ravenous, destructive maw has swallowed us up and spit us out, and now there is nothing left to do but die.

the faculty at my institution aren't exactly helpful. either they don't understand the urgency and depth of my despair, or they do and they're not giving me any useful strategies to help me live with it. the nature of sociology is the more you know, the less you know, but no one ever talks about how the more you know, the more you understand why so many prominent sociologists were morbidly depressed or wrote themselves to death. 

what is the point of being cursed with this terrible knowledge? how can any one of us going on, knowing the ugly realities of the world we live in with such specificity and depth? i'm in a cultural sociology course right now and still i cannot for the life of me find a way to make meaning out of this burdensome curse.

all this to say: how do you all sleep at night? what do you know that i don't? should i have reason to hope? or maybe there is no reason to hope, but a good reason to carry on learning and doing this work anyway? am i the only sociology student in the world to feel so engulfed in the miasma of never-ending, isolating dread that nothing any of us do matters?

I was a health-focused sociology major in undergrad, until I was talked into switching to a more practical program by my then boyfriend (now husband) who was a PhD Econ researcher and student- public service and public policy.

I've been working in social/ homeless services, and thinking about a career change - I initially sought information on teaching social studies but making the shift will require taking undergrad courses on top of certification courses. Considering the investment of time, I started thinking about what I really wanted to do, and I keep returning the dream that was born in all those years ago in my intro. to sociology course - to be a sociologist, focused on health and illness/medicine. But, I don't know where to start. As I said, I don't feel like I graduated with a competitive GPA, and ended up finishing with a different degree. Should I start with a Masters? Should I take some non-degreed MA courses? The main issue is funding, which is why I was drawn to a PhD program, but I don't know how realistic it is that I would be accepted, with a not super competitive undergrad GPA.

It&amp;#39;s almost mind-blowing to me now that I&amp;#39;m writing about symbolic violence, because I can say with confidence that I have experienced it myself. Also, now that I know this, I feel a lot better about my experiences, and it has validated my life and these lived experiences, as well as my stance on anti-ableism, especially with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;

I don't know what you call this kind of state but after realizing too much, for instance, how modernity failed us and anything about it just makes me want to succumb myself somewhere.

Maybe the fact that I'm getting uncomfortable is what shakes me from understanding what kind of privilege I have but the idea that people have been studying about the system since revolutions have began makes me wonder if there's still any hope because we're just on a cycle after all.

On the other hand, this made me respect more the area of studying for social sciences. I now see it clearly as equally important with the natural sciences where you try to comprehend as complex as a human's mind, structure of a society or even the composition of the Earth and the Universe.

I'll be looking into what happened to important people in Sociology after they died or something. 



Anyway,

I've been reading some chapters on Macionis' and Schaefer's book as suggested by our professor. If you have any interesting read to share with me, please do so. As much as this is depressing for me at the moment, I hope someone will say something about the beauty of studying sociology. I just really need something like that right now.

I have found lots of social-scientific research about what % of people believe in God/higher-being broken down by demographics, etc..

I'm also a little familiar with some sociological explanations of religious belief.

I'm also quite familiar with the arguments for and against God's existence. 

But what I can't find is social-scientific research investigating which arguments (if any) it is that people tend to employ, or which they offer when pressed. For instance, I'm assuming that the average person has little or no familiarity with the Ontological Argument, but it seems like almost everyone has a rough idea of the Teleological Argument and the Cosmological Argument, probably also the Moral Argument and Pascal's Wager. Looking ideally for quantitative research. Seems like it shouldn't be ultra-niche, but can't find anything on.

The context: in recent times there has been a little bit of discussion of a theistic proof that was immensley popular in early-modern Europe, the Common Consent Argument - roughly, in one form; almost everyone believes in God, so its reasonable for you to take this as evidence that the balance of evidence favor's God's existence, if you put any stock at all in other people's judgment. Anyway, seemed to me like this argument could be refined/advanced/repelled if there was some information about which particular arguments (or, more weakly, inklings, hunches) it is that most people are relying on.

I don't really want to go into too much detail about my research problem/question, hope that's okay.

I spent some time researching (as well as attending class that discusses various approaches) various qualitative and quantitative methods, however, for my topic I believe a mixed methods approach will be best. Current data available is quantitative and there isn't much produced by sociologists--which is why I believe that my research is needed for this topic. Current research discusses what the independent variables are for the dependent variables, however, how and why the independent variables affect the dependent variables are left unexplored. This is where my research comes in, I want to explore how and why the independent variables affect the dependent variables. Further, some independent variables have been left unaccounted for/unexplored/explored very briefly.

As such, I figured that a mixed methods approach would best fit my research question/problem. It will enable me to explore other independent variables (through the quantitative methods used) that I mentioned are either unaccounted for or briefly discussed/explored. It will also help me find how and why the independent variables affect the dependent variable(s), and explore further if there are other dependent variables (through qualitative methods). After reviewing the current literature, I noted the gaps in the available information, and I plan to explore the gaps, in hopes that future research I conduct can explain the gaps, the how(s), and why(s) of my research question/problem. The mixed methods approach will enable me to conduct a mezzo-level study, rather than a micro-level study like in qualitative methods. I should note that my leniency towards a mixed methods approach is also based on the temporal and spatial boundaries of my research, it will target a large city in Canada, with a rather large population demographic, and will be fairly contemporary.

The instruments I was thinking of using, after researching the sequential exploratory design, would be conducting interviews/focus groups first, analyze the data, and then from that build a survey around the data collected from the qualitative methods. This will enable me to create my survey around the data I have collected already, and will help me (hopefully) get the answers I need. I also considered just using one method, as opposed to a mixed-methods approach, but sticking to one method IMO would only produce half the results that I am looking for in my study. I realize that a mixed methods approach is way more costly, time consuming, and requires a certain amount of ""expertise"" (for lack of a better term) to conduct, which I have already thought of and will note in my mock proposal.

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to ask is do you recommend using a mixed-methods approach to a sociological study?

From my understanding there is a general shift in the definition/understanding of racism as an purely ideological phenomenon in earlier papers, towards an approach that includes structural and hierarchical factors into the concept. There also seems so be a separation between racialization, racial discrimination and racism, to make different aspects more accessible for theory and empiricism.

&amp;#x200B;

So, many of the authos i recently read, would probably agree, that there is no racism against white people, since there is no hierarchical structure in place that discriminates against white people, aswell as reproduces \*racism\* against whites, in the same way this structure exists and produces empirically measurable racial discrimination against blacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, where do we include the necessity of structural components, when we talk about racial discminination and ""beeing"" a racist? Could we argue that discrimination itself always needs a stuctural component, which would make the statement ""there is no discrimination against whites"" valid? If we continue this path, we could also argue that black people by definition can't be racist, which seems to be shared by some authors aswell. Now if we get to that point, what terminology do we use to discuss individual instances of ""racial"" discrimination that might occur to whites and how do we talk about blacks who share an ideology of ""racial superiority""? How would you argue in instances where a local hierarchical structure exists in which an ""overall"" minority becomes the majority and might discriminate others?

From my prevous understanding, I would have argued that blacks can be racists and whites can be the subject ob racial discrimination, but non of that is \*racism\* against whites, since overall, there is no hierarchical structure where white people are not in a dominant position.

I should have deferred my admission to next year but I didn’t know I had that option. Essentially, my body has been a psychiatric experiment for the last year, and when I started my first semester of my PhD program this year, my doctor set me up on an antidepressant with horrible side effects (random episodes of severe dizziness that impacted my ability to read or drive, and also chest pain that made me think I was going to have a heart attack). It took me forever to get an appointment with a new doctor, because my first one didn’t listen to my concerns. My next doctor decided to taper me off it without another medication to taper on to and I spent the last two weeks of the semester having near-constant panic attacks and thinking about death. I didn’t finish two of my classes because of it. I got an email about how I’m not in good academic standing and I’m really scared that all of my dreams are going to be ripped apart in front of me because I can’t get my body to cooperate and function the way I need it to.

Almost a year ago I posted a link to a survey I was doing for my Master thesis, asking people to participate. I have finally handed in my thesis and since some people were interested in the results here is a short summary:
I wanted to find out which personality traits often coincide with people committing more crimes than others. I got answers from over 300 participants who answered questions about their habits, personality and whether/how often they had committed different types of crime. I found that people who said they had committed more crimes tended to have less self-control, were more focussed on the present than on the future and didn't feel a strong connection to their selves in the future. I found a mediating effect for self-control in the relationship between time perspective and criminality as well as a mediating effect for time perspective in the relationship between socio-economic status and delinquency.
These findings help understand why some people might commit crimes while others don't and can possibly help in predicting and preventing crime as well as rehabilitating delinquents.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really interested in sociology, i&amp;#39;m not sure what job to go into with it yet because I feel like i&amp;#39;ll probably not get into a job that has anything to do with the degree like most college graduates, but it would be nice. So i&amp;#39;m trying to do my best,but i&amp;#39;m also in a situation where I need to finish this degree as soon as possible,as smooth as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been reading **a lot** about addiction in the Sociology for an interdisciplinary research paper, and I wanted to show two sides of the everlasting structure agency debate(that's how Sociology first got introduced to me).

My only problem is that I found, as expected,  a lot theories that touch on the structural side of addiction/deviance  yet I haven't been able to find a paper that also talks about the agency side of this discussion. I have explored macro- and micro-sociology, yet every theory/paper seems to only focus on the structural side of addiction. Am I just bad at reading between the lines? I feel like I'm missing something important insight wise.

I know Sociology works with structures, but there is room for agency a lot of times. My main question is, how do I identify agency, or even better, is there a theory that touches explicitly on agency in deviant behavior?

I hope this question is not too bold/comes across as lazy. I feel like I have really done a lot of research before even thinking about posing the question here.

Thanks for reading

I know not all friend groups are like this, but in my experience everyone is never equal.

Is this just part of human nature, that we can't help? 

Do we need social hierarchy for society to work?

Am I just talking a load of shit and these power structures don't even exist?

Im pretty desperate at the moment, as I&amp;#39;m currently writing an essay on Putnam&amp;#39;s perspective on social capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: you guys are amazing, thank you 😭❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double edit: I’ve now managed to find the book, thank you so much to the individual who reached out with and shared their PDF with me. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently about 3.5 years out of college, working as an aerospace engineer. I'm doing well in my field but have never been very passionate about it, and through my volunteer work, youth mentoring, and research, I've landed on the idea that I want to get a Ph.D. in Sociology, probably in the sociology of family or social psychology. I'd like to study the effects of positive adult role models on long-term outcomes of children, to try to more efficiently use parental and community resources. (Or something like that, I don't have a ton of sociological research knowledge currently.) I would eventually like to be a professor so that I could teach and do research.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a 3.5 GPA in my aerospace major and minored in English. I only took one entry-level sociology class in college. I haven't taken the GRE yet, but judging by practice test scores, I think with a bit of studying I should be able to do very well. I have 3 years of college research experience in an engineering lab, but no real publications.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to financial factors and my partner's school trajectory, I would want to apply for a Ph.D. program in 2020-2021 (2 application cycles from now). In the next two years, I plan to:

1. Take the GRE
2. Take an intro sociology class at a local university that would teach me some research methods, theory, and give me a chance to produce some writing samples with professor feedback to be used on applications
3. Read at least 1 book a week, both sociology focused and not, in an attempt to get my reading speed and comprehension up

So my questions for you are:

1. Is it ridiculous to think that I could get a Ph.D. in sociology considering where I am now? And
2. If not, what can I do over the next two years to strengthen my application and get myself ready to be successful if accepted?

For the second section regarding mobilization, I am choosing to look at high status, influencers on instagram.


•Introduction•

These are my ideas inspired by a paper we discussed in the course based on social capital. 

We have learned that once we have developed and established trust within our relationships, we increasing our social capital which allows access to intangible resources like insider information. Portes, 2001 (i think) 

Relationships are influenced depending on the setting they exist in. There are distinctions between the type of relations in our lives such as personal, familial, work, academic etc. These relations can also overlap. 

A primary benefit of possessing high social capital that stuck out to me was access to new information through relationships.

I am interested in a new, modern source of information such as the internet.


•Insider information through traditional source•

Prior to the internet, to get new information you relied on media such as newspaper, radio, television which to some extent is sufficient but the insider, personal information you obtained from your network is the key to your own mobilization. Insider information is information that could influence the direction of your life, company, group in a productive or innovative way. 

For example, advice about employment opportunities from friends and family is really helpful in periods of unemployment or being a student just graduated. 


• Internet as a game changer •

Now after the invention and development of the internet, individuals with a computer and wifi connection also have a direct access to not only expansive social networks on social media sites, some which I am interested being Instagram and Facebook. Search engines such as Google, Bing, etc. inform you about literally anything you can think of ( side q: does google know everything?). 

Depending on how the internet is used, it can used as a tool for opportunity. 


• Benefit of social capital through relationships•

Insider information gained from social relationships is rich in the sense that it also has a sociable benefit to it. There is literature linking increased frequency of social interaction with enjoyment enhancement and reward system activation (NIH). There are benefits to individuals‘ wellbeing through increased positive social interactions. If you are interacting with your social networks in pursuit of exchange of ideas, collaboration and innovation, that physical interaction with another person can leave you feeling invigorated more than before.  

This then brings me to the question of:

How does online social interaction affect users? 

The findings of benefits to well being that face to face social interaction provides is not applicable to social interaction that occurs on the internet. 

Digital social interaction does have similar effects on dopamine levels. I am sure there is literature on that.



•Economic Mobility•

Not only have institutions of work and education moved online in their job listings and application process, there are content creators on YouTube that post an array of videos both educational and motivational which intend to help you with a process you may be unfamiliar with. There are videos made to assist you in preparing your cover letter, resume, interviewing skills and questions. Becoming familiar with these aspects of the job and interview process    is necessary in influencing the likelihood of getting the job you want. 

YouTube can be used as a learning tool that can assist in obtaining employment as well as information about anything else you are interested in. 

(Some of my favorites being historical documentaries, yoga and Meditation videos, as well as though provoking discussion by a variety of thinkers like Alan Watts,  Jordan Peterson, Ram Dass, etc. ) you can learn so much on YouTube! 

There are millions of videos posted on YouTube and there are also creators which create content that mobilize individuals and assist in enhancing the likely hood their achievement of opportunities. 

The company, YouTube, itself provides employment. 

Central point that I believe is may be more relevant to economic sociology :

Examining the process of companies that hire content creators?

What level of analysis would be most interesting? 

Ideally I would want my analysis to be on the individual level. 

I am interested in people who use the internet as their source of income.

I think there is a distinction to be made between individual‘s whose jobs are through the internet or if they are based on the internet.

I guess to specify it down I would want to examine influencers on social media, who have a following (dense social network) and recognition (degree of virality), and have been able to use these factors to establish economic opportunities through branding work with a company / sponsorships, trying and promoting products, etc.

I have some of my theory written on another document relating social capital and influencers, but i want to find out 

How high status influencers on instagram interact with companies? 

How their perception and relationship to the app change once it becomes your main source of income? This could also applies to creators employed by YouTube.

Does it put them in a creator‘s dilemma? 

In order to have a high status you must stay relevant so does this constrain an individual‘s creative freedom? 


I can write more about the creators dilemma bc y not, but its already getting lengthy.

I would really appreciate feedback, i understand if its a bit long haha peace!

I looked into political science thinking that would be a way to make a difference, and from that came across sociology - a field I had forgotten about completely. 

What I want to do is help with social inequalities (especially LGBTQ+, race, and gender) by using statistics and other “behind the scenes” work. I’ve never been an up-front person, but I’m passionate and want to support those who are upfront people. This is one reason I considered political science - if I could find a politician who believes in what I believe in, I could potentially join his or her campaign and work behind the scenes to bring talking points and facts to light. 

I know this is a little scatterbrained, but hopefully you all can follow. Is sociology the right field for me? Does a different field sound like a better fit?

Im a third year Sociology student in The Netherlands.

Recently during one of my subjects, we were taught again that race just doesn't exist, it's based on false science or whatever, ""use ethnicity instead"". Which is fine by me, but something keeps bugging me.

&amp;#x200B;

So Bourdieu said that class doesn't exist, its a social construct, but we can use it as sociologists for empirical studies etc. Class basically came to existence because we use it, right? But how does that differ from race? Race is being used, people discriminate based on race, not ethnicity. An article im reading right now states: 

&gt;Differential treatment occurs when individuals are treated unequally because of their race.

 So if it's used by society, how can you deny it's existence, or , even if the origin of the concept is wrong? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When we had to debate about the question: ""should the government include race in it's data collection?"" I could think of many reasons why they should (and why they shouldn't). In the end the teacher wanted to reassure that noone **actually** agreed with the statement, like it was something really stupid and incorrect to agree with, which I just don't get to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you could shine any light on this, or just give me your opinion, that would be greatly appreciated :)

I have a research question in mind that I'd like to investigate, however I'm not sure if I would be measuring it correctly. Based on literature and conversations with students I've had in my time working in Student/Campus Life at my university, students who work steady jobs happen to notice that they improve at time management. I want to take this a step further. I want to investigate how university students working paid labor affects a students' ability to keep up with course readings.

Survey questions as of now are as follows:

1. On average, how many hours a week do you work for pay during the school year?  

2. On average, how long (in hours) do you spend on course readings, each week? 

3. In a 12 week semester, on average, how often (in weeks) have you been able to complete all your course readings before each class.

4. Are you a part-time or full-time student? 

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking goes as follows. I plan on dividing responses between full-time and part-time because obviously students in part time will have more time to keep up with readings. If I decide to use interval responses in 1 and 3, I will use PSPP cross-tabs to determine a significant relationship between the variables. If I just let students enter a number of their choice, then regression.  From the respondents who answer that they've been able to complete almost all or all their readings, I will go back to their work hours and see if I notice a trend (example: out of all the students who were able to keep up with all 12 weeks of readings, a majority are students who work 15 hours). 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, from the people who were able to keep up with most of their readings, I'd like to use question #2 to determine how long should students who work and would like to keep up with their readings should ideally spend on their readings a week. Probably by categorizing all the work hours possible into like 6 categories (0, 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29+) then out of students who were successful in keeping up with their readings, averaging out the hours.For example, students who work 20 hours and completed most to all of their readings were able to do so in 7 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this all sound logical? Or am I missing something? I appreciate everyone reading this. Thank you in advance

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been fortunate enough to get the opportunity to conduct a survey for 500 students at my university and I want to do something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a research question in mind that I&amp;#39;d like to investigate, however I&amp;#39;m not sure if I would be measuring it correctly. Based on literature and conversations with students I&amp;#39;ve had in my time working in Student/Campus Life at my university, students who work steady jobs happen to notice that they improve at time management. I want to take this a step further. I want to investigate how university students working paid labor affects a students&amp;#39; ability to keep up with course readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey questions as of now are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, how many hours a week do you work for pay during the school year?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, how long (in hours) do you spend on course readings, each week? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12 week semester, on average, how often (in weeks) have you been able to complete all your course readings before each class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a part-time or full-time student? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking goes as follows. I plan on dividing responses between full-time and part-time because obviously students in part time will have more time to keep up with readings. If I decide to use interval responses in 1 and 3, I will use PSPP cross-tabs to determine a significant relationship between the variables. If I just let students enter a number of their choice, then regression.  From the respondents who answer that they&amp;#39;ve been able to complete almost all or all their readings, I will go back to their work hours and see if I notice a trend (example: out of all the students who were able to keep up with all 12 weeks of readings, a majority are students who work 15 hours). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, from the people who were able to keep up with most of their readings, I&amp;#39;d like to use question #2 to determine how long should students who work and would like to keep up with their readings should ideally spend on their readings a week. Probably by categorizing all the work hours possible into like 6 categories (0, 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29+) then out of students who were successful in keeping up with their readings, averaging out the hours.For example, students who work 20 hours and completed most to all of their readings were able to do so in 7 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, you’re learning about what’s wrong with society and why it is the way it is.

How do you fix inequality when the whole world, since the beginning of time, has been built on a system of power and domination of one group over another? These are the kinds of questions social scientists seek to answer, but what if there is no answer? Or no solution? As a society, what do we do then?

So what are some resources i could go to for reliable information about politics and current issues? If this is less a sociology thing then a politics thing i apologize, i just feel like their linked. I'm most interested in how what's happening now will shape events in the future.

I'm currently reading through Social Research Methods by Seale.

Since sex is a biological characteristic, it can’t be controlled. Gender, on the other hand, is much more of an open characteristic.

I'm  in a tough spot right now and I need the help of a professional  sociologist so that I can finish my primary research source for my  Composition II Essay and synopsis. I'm running out of time and  everywhere I've turned so far has lead to rejection. I'm writing about  the social effects of a zombie outbreak, and I need a professional to  answer questions about this topic. If you agree to answering my  questions your answers will be cited in my essay as a source, and I  shall make a synopsis about you. I will need some background about your  qualifications as a sociologist. Thank you so very much if you agree to  do this. If you don't want to write more than one sentence it'll be ok, I  just need something in order to write a synopsis.

What academic qualifications do you have as being a sociologist? (What's your highest degree in sociology?)

What career qualifications do you have as being a sociologist?

1. What government institution do you believe would fall first when a zombie apocalypse occurs?
2. Do you believe new nations would form if a zombie apocalypse happened?
3. How do you believe society would break down in the case of a zombie apocalypse
4. How do you think society would cope with the new zombie infestation?
5. What ways would society defend themselves against zombies?
6. What institutions from society would survive if a zombie outbreak happened?
7. How much hope do you believe society would have if zombies invaded most urban areas?
8. What new institutions do you think society would create if zombies infested the world?
9. When do you believe a push back against zombies would occur from the time the first infection happens.
10. How would society cope after the zombie apocalypse ends?
11. Where do you believe society would be safe in the USA compared to other regions if a zombie infestation happens?
12. What would society need to survive a zombie horde in your opinion?
13. Would societies from different areas of the world be connected still if the zombie apocalypse happened?
14. Would radical feelings spring from a zombie apocalypse in society?
15. Are there any other comments you would like to add about how zombies would change society?

To use as an example while most Hispanists and other scholars and lovers of Latin America would be able to explains the dances of Peruvian Indians or the major economic trends of Ecuador in the 90s and how the Federalists won the Mexican Revolution of the 20th century, they are quite ignorant of how Saint Seiya took Latin America by storm especially Mexico and was overall the most beloved anime/manga in the continent especially in Mexico (where it singlehandedly launch the popularity of anime/manga in the country and still remains a beloved childhood memory and most popular classic in the country). Saint Seiya along with DBZ and Sailor Moon were practically everything any kid with a television watched every Saturday and everyday once reruns began and merchandise sold like Twinkies for much of the 90s. Its almost impossible to see an adult with an average childhood who grew up in the 90s who had not watched all those 3 shows once. At the minimal even someone who didn't grow up with TV from the commoners stock at least can recognize one of those anime because of everyday conversations at school.

Another example is how history books on 90s Britain barely mention anything about soccer and only list stuff such as Margaret Thatcher not running another term and terrorist attacks, etc. In particular the comment about Thatcher amused since they often write about how relieved the British populace was about Thatcher not running another term. I lived with my mom at various points in the UK during the 90s and trust me most people in the city I lived in in Scotland was not cheering or holding parties, etc. In fact most people at the bar or in the playgrounds, etc were more concerned about just going on in their daily lives. I heard much more conversation about local farm profits, beer, the diseased sheeps, college sports, etc than anything about Thatcher, terrorist attacks, Arafat's visit to Britain shown on the news (I was there when I saw the meeting and discussions,), and the construction of the Millennium Dome. Only even I remember that shooke veryone in my town was the death of Princess Diana and even that was forgotten shortly after despite how news Media kept talking about it for months after she died.

There are too many examples to list from how the cinema of Turkey is rarely discussed by Turcophiles to the daily junk food Greeks commonly eat (especially beloved brand chips) or how Israel as its share of underground computer gaming scene that paid more attention to FPS tournaments than what was happening during the brief invasion of Lebanon. How can so many fans and experts of foreign countries and exotic cultures memorize the details such as how traditional hats are made but ignore that most people spend more time just chilling in their own favorite hobbies such as the local Rap scene or their own Americanophile groups who spend more time watching American movies than reading their country's classic literature and studying traditional dances? How can they not be aware of the most popular soap opera in Russia despite the fact they can pay attention to what's Putin is doing and memorize facts of various major cities and regions in Russia? While we're at it how come none of them ever bother memorizing the local villages and less significant cities of Russia, something that Russian themselves would know especially surrounding towns and city near a Russian's home? Or of the most recent top 20s in Algeria's music chart?

Can anyone explain this of why people with philia and/knowledge of a foreign country or another culture memorize traditional stuff mostly forgotten or barely known by the general populace such and major events like terrorist attacks in Ireland that most Irish people don't know about (and even those who saw it live on the news when it was happening had already forgotten about)?

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate every comment left on this thread and I will keep it to refer to in the future. You are all right, I should be proud of myself. I have been very proud of myself for the most part but sometimes the negativity still gets to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first post and I’m happy I made it. The Reddit community is awesome, thank you again everybody &amp;lt;3 &lt;/p&gt;

Short summary of the topic in question:
In today's world, the way in which we build and sustain relationships is based around technology which is radically different from the one our ancestors got to interact with. In this way, we can ask the following questions:
- What role does technology play in society?
- How does it affect individuals and their social links?
- Can we, and should we, attempt to establish these observations as results which we find to be ""good"" or ""bad"" for society?
- And finally, can we look into the future and see what it holds with the close study of certain trends and rules built around our observations of technology?

Then i remember they discussing about some ""short phases"" where the great depression of 29 was one of those ""peaks"" of the reason era, or how ""Woodstock""  was one of peaks of the emotional era. 

I found some articles online talking about Hegel's Triad, where War is a moment of ""antithesis"" (reason). But i can't find anything else or deeper than this. 

I talked to some friends and nobody seems to know anything about this subject, i can't find anything more on the internet but that's maybe because I don't know what to look for. Or was it a dream or whatever? Is there a discussion about this?

**Background:** As seems fairly evident, in the US, politics has become increasingly polarized over the last generation (if not longer than that). One reason is that people are isolating themselves from other ideologies, but it seems to me that it's also because they (A) both use terms differently when they discuss things creating ""crosstalk"", and (B) at a basal level have opposing fundamental values on the ordering of society.

**To illustrate:**

**(A)** Both liberals and conservatives value ""freedom"". However, I think they tend to mean different things when they say this which is perhaps different from the distinction between positive and negative liberty. It seems to me that on an individual/group dynamic conservatives are more likely to place value on the freedom of the individual over the group, while liberals are more likely to place value on the freedom of the group rather than the individual. So as a hierarchy for conservatives individual freedom &gt; group freedom while for liberals group freedom &gt; individual freedom.

Take gay marriage as an example. Under my hypothesis conservatives are OK with opposition to gay marriage ideologically because an individual's particular belief that gay marriage is immoral (coupled with the power of majority rule) takes precedence over the freedom of the group. On the other hand, liberals are OK with suppressing the absolute freedom of the individual as it conflicts with the freedom of the group. Hence, a the freedom of the group to act (gay individuals to marry) outweigh the freedom of the individual to act (a particular to enact power to prevent gay people for marrying for personal moral reasons).

Therefore, because they are using this term in completely different ways without ever qualifying what they mean they create ""crosstalk"", or talk past each other, never see eye to eye and there is a failure of communication and understanding.

**(B)** The reason for this may be because of the way liberals and conservatives view the ordering of society. Clearly in America individual as a cultural value far outweighs collectivism. However, just in talking with people over the years it seems to me that liberally-minded people are more likely to value collectivism than conservative-minded people are (hence why communism and fascism are the extremes of each ideology). Liberals seem to be more willing to give up absolute freedom for the freedom of the group than conservatives are. As a side, this may explain why public shaming is more effective on Democratic politicians than Republican ones.

**Question:**
That was just one too long example (and critiques are welcome - perhaps a counter example would be marijuana legalization). In addition to discovering information that discusses my hypothesis I'm interested in other fundamental concepts that divide liberals and conservatives. My end goal is to take these concepts and then talk to liberals and conservatives about them - both to get their viewpoints but also to help them understand differences between them. Please note, I do not mean specific ideological positions. So I used gay marriage above, but that was just an example to illustrate the idea.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a sociologist not am I in the social sciences - I just like to think about things. I'm more interested in having discussions and coming up with more correct answers than being correct. So I'm reasonable. I put this disclaimer here because too often when I try to have conversations here on Reddit they devolve into ether people who want to argue or pedants who require hyper-correctness. I'd just like to have an interesting conversation knowing that some people will be more knowledgeable than others. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I'll quickly try to convince you of this now.

Given that Durkheim says ""A social fact is normal... ...when it is present in the average society of that species at the corresponding phase of its evolution."", you might think that the distinction is a statistical one. But it's not obvious how we denote a species or phase of development. Durkheim doesn't explicitly say this but I think it's clear that his understanding of those two concepts as explained in Chapter V are dependent on the social theory at hand. The complexity of the relationships between agents determines species, and change in the arrangement of relationships constitutes development from one phase to the next. Now suppose that we have a phenomena that is fully explained by social forces and is not common in the context that it is explained. Then a new phase of development can be formed by fixing the orientation of the social forces that cause the phenomena. All social forces are constant and omnipresent. All that it means to ""fix"" them is to say that we will only consider societies which are organized in such a way that social force X has orientation Y. Since the phenomena exists, the set of such societies won't be empty. From the above reasoning, we can make any explained social phenomena normal by taking those societies and denoting them as either a species or a phase of development.

Just to provide further evidence, he says that the job of science is to explain normal phenomena and distinguish it from pathological phenomena (normal =&gt; explained). He also mentions psychological forces as being a source of abnormality, which are the only behavioral forces that aren't social (unexplained =&gt; abnormal). I'll add quotes here later if I remember, sorry I didn't take notes, but this would complete the logical argument started in the previous paragraph which showed explained =&gt; normal.

Of course, Durkheim goes on to say that ""a social fact [with respect to a certain species] can be construed as normal or abnormal"" (start of IV), which seems to be an issue because as far as I can tell, a social fact can be defined as something which is:

i) observable/measurable
ii) the result of social forces

Given the second condition, it would seem that Durkheim is saying that some things that are the result of social forces (i.e. explained by the social theory) are pathological. My current view on this is that Durkheim has confused himself into thinking that the normal/pathological distinction is more than it is.

I'm looking at the *Social Construction* of the '**Other**' through printed media analysis.
My idea is to draw a comparison between the language used to portray homeless people and the language used to portray unwanted urban wildlife or pest animals (e.g. pigeons). 


I had originally thought of using Prof. Colin Jerolmack's methodology, which is historical media analysis. On his paper *[How Pigeons Became Rats: The Cultural-Spacial Logic of Problem Animals](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2008.55.1.72?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)* he looked at changes in the discourse that the printed media of New York used to portray pigeons though time. He focused on the New York Times, and analyzed around 150 years' worth of newspaper articles. 


I thought I could look at the discourse used by the media to portray homeless people, and then look at the discourse used by that same media to portray unwanted/pest animals. Then I could compare the two to see if there are similar patterns, such as same adjectives. 


But the more I think about it, the less sure I am of this methodology for my research.

I just finished a summer position with the provincial government as a research assistant for the governing transportation body (total waste of time. I applied to a bunch of internal positions while there but they instituted a spending freeze after a new government was elected and all those jobs are getting cancelled), and now I'm unemployed again and broke as shit after getting paid minimum wage by the government all summer. I'm about to finish a mental health and addictions continuing education certificate that I took just because a bunch of courses from my undergrad counted towards it and I needed the loan money to live. 

I'm well versed in all manner of qual, SPSS and reporting. I know I need to teach myself R, I'm planning on starting that soon while I'm unemployed. I have the desire to work in social research, I have the skills to work as an assistant (lateral moves forever!) or analyst, I just don't have the graduate degree.

I don't think I can stomach or afford a graduate degree at this point, especially if it leaves me sitting in the same place I am right now. 

I hate market research. I hate working like a dog for a mediocre salary with no overtime and I dislike the super corporate environment of most of the large companies. I've applied to some research assistant positions at consultancies similar to the one I worked at for 2.5 years and haven't heard anything.

I feel like a lack of an MA is really holding me back, even though I wouldn&amp;#39;t really get anything out of it other than the piece of paper, the line on my resume, and a whole bunch more debt.

Budget: £350-700 (maybe I can go lower?)

Preferred Specs: 256GB SSD (SSD for speed and also 256GB so dont have to worry about 128 SSD filling up fast!)

Edit: Thank you /u/DillyTheWaffles and /u/JoshuaPeterson for the suggestions, I'm looking into those keywords you offered to search for, and the podcasts. However, I'm still hoping someone lists a more clear path for me to take. Like maybe an academic course, or something similar.

I'll zoom in on what I'm looking for: My goal is to figure out how to preserve my contact with communities I live in, even after they had been broken up by gentrification. And for communities to use this method, too.

And also, I want to reach this goal in a way that isn't furthering gentrification. For example, I can think of making an app that surveys people about where they lived and when, and map out how groups of different regions intermix over time, and have it answer questions like: ""Where is the largest concentration of people that used to live in that ""cool"" neighborhood back in year X?"" ... But creating such an app, will only fuel gentrification. Because, assuming it will be popular, the people selling houses could use it as another variable to determine where prices should be higher.

TL;DR I guess I'm asking if there's any research/course that help me understand how gentrification works... to such a degree that you can plan as a community the direction you want to go in, without furthering the problem in the process.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which fields of study are involved in such research?

I will happily take myself elsewhere if directed to do so! Please help a junior sociology scholar out!

My dissertation concerns administrative court records from two different tribunals, and there are quite a few records (600 from one tribunal, and 300 from the second). I do not have an existing spread sheet of case/thematic nodes and had planned on programming these directly into my Nvivo project. I have some thematic nodes in mind, but I'm running into an issue regarding my planned case nodes. There are several straight-forward characteristics of the cases that I had planned to code as case classifications, such as the allegations and punishments rendered in the court records. However, it seems that the case classification attribute values have to be mutually exclusive - am I understanding that correctly? Can only one value for one attribute be assigned for each case? In the majority of cases, there are multiple allegations and punishments at play, so I was hoping to be able to set these all out as a list and select several as warranted. For example, to have the attribute of ""Allegations"" with a value text list of the 15 or so allegations that come up in these courts, with the ability to select several values from the list if warranted for each case. Is this actually an impossible task? Is there a way to do this via the case classifications function? If not, is there another way that you would recommend? The existing Nvivo guides have been very useful, but the examples often pertain to demographic info of research participants (like age, were you would want those values to be mutually exclusive), which is less relevant for my purposes.

The back-up plan is to have several attribute categories (i.e Allegation 1, Allegation 2, etc;) so that I can correctly capture everything, but this is going to significantly increase the coding time (as well as complicate the analysis), so I'm hoping that I don't have to do it that way!

A little bit about me: I'm a rising sophomore at a large state university double-majoring in Sociology and Computer Science. Like a lot of people who end up in sociology, I was thinking about individual interactions as a result of hierarchy, institutions, and social facts long before I'd ever heard of the discipline. I began thinking this way as a result of online political discourse as a middle-schooler, and by the time I applied to college I was 1) pretty sure I was a communist and 2) convinced that sociology was what I wanted to study. Thus far I've only taken the intro course, and while I was exposed to some of the greats (Mills, Durkheim, etc.), I still feel like I know almost nothing about the different directions sociology can go. I've read articles by a few professors at my school's department, but that's about it. Also, I really love the basic statistical/quant work I've done in the past, so I can't imagine myself doing completely qualitative research regardless of my substantive interests.

I realize that it's a little early to be zeroing in on a specialty, but I'm fairly certain that I want to pursue a PhD in sociology immediately after undergrad. From the (very little) research I've done about doctoral programs, I get the impression that successful applicants have a strong sense of their specific sociological interests. Again, I know I have time. I don't expect to decide on a dissertation topic or plan out the entire trajectory of my academic career--I'd just like to know how I can start figuring out what I prefer studying within sociology. Everything seems incredibly cool!

So, questions: Did your research interests naturally narrow as you took more sociology classes, or did you actively take steps to find your focus? Are there specialties that lend themselves more naturally to quantitative work? What are some essential readings for your area of focus? I'm particularly curious about medical and political sociology as well as sociology of labor, but I'm not ruling anything out at this point.

I am currently writing my master's thesis, it's about the working circumstances of MCA's (medicine counter assistants, although the name in my country is different) working in pharmacies. 
My professor/supervisor suggested to do a case study design, combined with a grounded theory strategy. That's what I did, and now I am working out my results after writing the theoretical and methodological part of the thesis. The problem now is: he did not once give me feedback (tbf, I only requested it once and did not press further). Now after finally reading what i wrote until now, he asked me to step away from the case study design and add random interviews for better results. I have a few problems with this - first, I want to finish the thesis in the next two weeks and I don't want to rewrite everything and add more interviews! Second, I don't think that's what you're supposed to do - even if I don't get the most interesting results, surely it's better to work with this than to randomly add data and pick results which suit me (him) better? 
I don't know what to do now because on the one hand, of course he knows better, and he will be one of the people grading me. On the other hand, I don't think that my thesis will turn out bad, even if the research isn't top - I don't want to stay at university and do research any way. 

What would you do? How do I approach my next (second!) meeting with him, which will be next week? 

Thank you very much in advance.

Currently, I'm in a spot were I need to make some big decisions and am looking for help from someone who maybe has navigated a similar situation; or anyone really. 

I am mid-bachelors for sociology. For a long time, it has been a big goal of mine to publish academic articles or books in sociology, anthro, criminal justice, and so forth. If I had to hazard a guess, I want to be at doing that in roughly ten years. My romanticized vision of myself is that I perform some kind of social work 9-5 and then go home to read, research, and write for journals. Recently, and due to an associate degree I hold in a different field, I have been offered a job doing impactful, soul-fulfilling social work. First, that's about half of my life goals checked off on it's own. Second, this position at this company has a track record of getting people's foot in the door for other, more prestigious and well-paying work in human services, criminal justice, etc. All this to say, I'd be a bit dumb to pass it up. 

However, I don't think I can square the circle of work and school. I  have a unique situation at school that doesn't let me drop below the maximum credits each semester; and even the simplest classes at this college are intensive. I've tried working stuff out with professor's and they are generally unable to afford me anything that may ease the inevitable time crunch. So here are my questions:

1) Given your knowledge on the availability of jobs in sociological fields; is it worth it to forgo school to take a job that you are a good fit for and is a good fit for you? Especially if there's a good chance it leads you to better work with or without a degree (people who have moved on to better jobs from this one have sometimes had one and sometimes not)?

2) In the instance that my ultimate decision is to leave school, is it any more difficult to get published in journals or by presses without a degree? I could see a situation were a potential publisher looks solely at the quality and contributions of your work, but I could definitely see them googling your name to check qualifications as well.

The job I'm being offered is what I would do with a degree anyway, and if that were the only consideration I probably wouldn't hesitate to leave school.

How does social ownership of the companies avoid capital concentration?  
And I might be a fool here, but by social ownership I mean having the employees vote, directly or through delegates, the decisions of the company.  
It seems to me that voting might make the company take better decisions, because you have more people voting, but then you have to know which are those decisions that the boss should be taking that isn't taking, and that the voters would.

One thing is they'll spread the salaries more. Ok. But this still doesn't necessarily avoid concentration between companies. Like, google's money spread across all its workers would be more money per worker than a local ice cream shop's money spread among the workers.

It seems to me that as long as the company are still in a sort of capitalist system, etc.

Now, possible solutions:

One, I tend to think that the problem is oligopolization. Like, maybe there are 2 companies, but instead of racing to the bottom of what their prices can be, keeping each person paid by the company in the limit of subsitance with the salary, the acomodate in an above than that level.  
And the other: Maybe if instead of having competing companies (competing companies that then don't want to compete), or maybe companies that decide their own salary... and therefore compete or wtv; you just have to have state owned companies, we're all employees of one company, the state, whose actions we vote on, and the salary is spread among us all.

Remember that the salary was, in my hipótesis or wtv, spread inside the company, but concentrated between companies. So if there's only one company, etc., and that company would be more or less the same as having the state be the owner of all.


One problem I'm seeing with this, is the assumption that with employees voting the salaries are going to be spread evenly in the company (evenly means, 1 quantity of effort, however you measure it, equals the same quantity of money for everyone). 
I have the thought that maybe the largest sectors, or... smaller but united sectors would form inside that electoral system, to get majority and vote for a better salary for them... Idk.

Even in the state, like, in the state we're a lot of people under the state, so a group of employees from one company (state company, but wtv) wouldn't be able to get majority, but still across companies large groups of people maybe yes.. Idk.

Would it be better than capitalism though? Idk, I don't want to keep on thinking, maybe yes.

I dont mention that many classic writers on consumption and im just not sure if my arguments are substantial/if all are relevant. Just wanted to see if someone could help with this.
The actual question is as follows: 
To what extent do you agree with the suggestion that consumption is the primary means for identity-construction in modern developed societies?

I have split identity into individual and group identity, then i argued how consumption constructs both of those separately. For individual identity, I argued that people use objects in an aspirational way, so to relate themselves to their 'dream' selves and thats how it constructs their identity in part. I also mention the main industries behind building these aspirations for people(marketing and advertising) end up prying on people's insecurities hence people consume even more to make themselves 'better'. Im not sure if this ends up being a tangent, but it seemed relevant to me. Throughout all of this i provide my own examples as well as basing it off academic sources. 
For group identity, i argue that people use objects to mark themselves as members of a group. so i use hebidge's work on subcultures, then i generally talk about how style nowadays is said to represent group identity to an extent and also talk about how people end up in neo-tribes based on lifestyle choices(healthy eating and fitness). 
Would really love some feedback on this. are these arguments good or is there something im massively missing and overlooking? I really struggled to come up with something that addressed the question fully so i could really use some help! My essay is only 1500 words long so i dont have that much to work with either.

My interviewees are all affected by grief as a result of bereavement, and they constantly find that there are no norms/rules/guidelines for how to express/talk/mention/relate to it in social interactions. Not that there is a taboo, it's just a total lack of norms/rules/guidelines for how to address it, and hence both my interviewees and their friends/family found it hard to express and talk about, because they are all the time worried that the given act is inappropriate.

&lt;p&gt;My interviewees are all affected by grief as a result of bereavement, and they constantly find that there are no norms/rules/guidelines for how to express/talk/mention/relate to it in social interactions. Not that there is a taboo, it&amp;#39;s just a total lack of norms/rules/guidelines for how to address it, and hence both my interviewees and their friends/family found it hard to express and talk about, because they are all the time worried that the given act is inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

Isn't all knowledge communicated via human language, by this definition, socially constructed?


My second question, and the subject of the title, regards Witherspoon et. al's 2007 paper in *Genetics* titled ""Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations"" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/). In this paper, the authors address an argument typically put forth in support of race constructivism, namely that individuals differ more *within* populations than *between* them. This turns out to be true if the number of polymorphic loci being analyzed is small. However, if thousands of loci are used individuals can accurately be categorized into populations, and as more and more loci are used the probability of finding two individuals in the same population who are genetically more dissimilar than two individuals from different populations quickly approaches zero.


What, if anything, has been the consensus response from mainstream sociology and race constructivism to this paper? In my view, this work seems to cast some doubt on the notion that race is purely a social construct, and not in some ways biological. I would love to hear other peoples' views on this. Thank you!

So a brief introduction. I have a bachelor in Economics but for my Master I plan to switch to Sociology. I want to do a PhD after that and my goal is to be a professor one day. I was a teaching and research assistant for Economics. I am a good student and I live in Europe in case that information helps. 

I am aware that switching from economics to sociology most likely means a pay cut in the future and I'm fine with that. I don't need to be the next Warren Buffett. However people often make it sound like a PhD in Sociology is just miserable with almost no chance of getting a decent job. As I said I do not want to become rich but I would like to have a job one day that allows me to have a family without needing to worry constantly how I will feed them next week. So I was wondering is a PhD in Sociology really such a bad idea? 

Thank you for your help.

I have been to college previously I started to realize working a 9-5 with something I would lose interest in very fast (or wasn’t very passionate about in the first place) would be the best choice so I dropped out of the program to work and figure out what I wanna do with my life... anyways about 2 years ago I had a friend that opened my eyes more about social sciences. 

At most times I can’t find myself able to stop thinking about what we are doing in this world. Why we have the interactions we do, why is our perception on something a certain way is seen, even though consciously we are aware of the difference (I have trouble trying to explain well over text so I might sound crazy). Everything about us as people with how we “choose” or “don’t not choose” what emotions &amp; etc that we deliver. there is so much I wouldn’t be able to explain it all. 

My question is how do I know fully if sociology is the right path or physiology. My end goal would be research hopefully. I have no backing with any of these. My knowledge comes from reads and becoming aware etc. This feeling of how passionate I am to understand our social and physiological reasoning is very recent within the span of 2 years I have build this mental structure of always wanting to know and find more. This is what scares me the most I don’t know if this is a natural faze or if I’m really just moving in a path of good, I believe that I wouldn’t be satisfied if I didn’t know, or have some leads and understanding about this world, our society and our conscious/unconscious minds. but I don’t understand why I haven’t be able to compared this all along and why a large about of people (I guess mostly my age) are VERY not aware of the psychological and social structure around them. Their social movements are very contradicting and how some movements aren’t really helping yet mostly for status of the leading individuals. For example I am a black dude and I get questioned and told sometimes that I’m and racist towards black people. One of the most recent is  because “I didn’t see black panther” which makes no logical sense, and how that statement alone is doing more harm in some cases then the racist they may hate... This may not be the best situation to use as a reference, but whenever I encounter conversations in the same structure as this from all different issues or none issues it truly baffles me how unaware majority of the people in our society really are, it almost as if they are zombies. 

Am I crazy? And just making no sense? 

How do I become  ready for a university? 
And what major would fit me best with reading what you have, this is just 2 percent of the questions I have about our conscious and social decisions.

I also thought about a PhD but I feel like I am so new to this that it’s disrespectful to even talk about at this time. 

I hope someone would write back this is my first time posting really on reddit so I hope I made some sense. Thank you!

I have been to college previously I started to realize working a 9-5 with something I would lose interest in very fast (or wasn’t very passionate about in the first place) would be the best choice so I dropped out of the program to work and figure out what I wanna do with my life... anyways about 2 years ago I had a friend that opened my eyes more about social sciences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At most times I can’t find myself able to stop thinking about what we are doing in this world. Why we have the interactions we do, why is our perception on something a certain way is seen, even though consciously we are aware of the difference (I have trouble trying to explain well over text so I might sound crazy). Everything about us as people with how we “choose” or “don’t not choose” what emotions &amp;amp; etc that we deliver. there is so much I wouldn’t be able to explain it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is how do I know fully if sociology is the right path or physiology. My end goal would be research hopefully. I have no backing with any of these. My knowledge comes from reads and becoming aware etc. This feeling of how passionate I am to understand our social and physiological reasoning is very recent within the span of 2 years I have build this mental structure of always wanting to know and find more. This is what scares me the most I don’t know if this is a natural faze or if I’m really just moving in a path of good, I believe that I wouldn’t be satisfied if I didn’t know, or have some leads and understanding about this world, our society and our conscious/unconscious minds. but I don’t understand why I haven’t be able to compared this all along and why a large about of people (I guess mostly my age) are VERY not aware of the psychological and social structure around them. Their social movements are very contradicting and how some movements aren’t really helping yet mostly for status of the leading individuals. For example I am a black dude and I get questioned and told sometimes that I’m and racist towards black people. One of the most recent is  because “I didn’t see black panther” which makes no logical sense, and how that statement alone is doing more harm in some cases then the racist they may hate... This may not be the best situation to use as a reference, but whenever I encounter conversations in the same structure as this from all different issues or none issues it truly baffles me how unaware majority of the people in our society really are, it almost as if they are zombies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy? And just making no sense? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I become  ready for a university? 
And what major would fit me best with reading what you have, this is just 2 percent of the questions I have about our conscious and social decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also thought about a PhD but I feel like I am so new to this that it’s disrespectful to even talk about at this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone would write back this is my first time posting really on reddit so I hope I made some sense. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

+ Maybe my choice of topic needs to be changed; I'm definitely struggling.

1. Consumption of food affects the environment, so what impact does a flexitarian diet have on the environment?

2. What is the relationship between food consumption, society, and the environment?

+ This is the research purpose &amp; significance:

* Most people are aware of vegetarian and veganism but there have been studies that show that veganism is not the way to environmental sustainability. Balance is crucial in everyday objects, habits, etc. So, a flexitarian diet may just help with keeping the biodiversity of the planet at a sustained level. The planet is suffering from human consumption and waste, one step to help ease the gas emission is changing the population’s diet into a flexitarian diet. This diet is friendly to the environment because it is semi-vegetarian where meat is still consumed but eating less of it. Animal by-products can still be consumed as well but moderately. 

+ My TA explained that:

&gt; Right now your topic is not sociological enough except if you tweak your second question and skip the first one mostly (you can only answer this to set out your problem and then analyze why people associate flexitarian diet less with environmental consciousness compared to veganism. The people’s association is the sociology there not the diets.) In sociology, we are interested in the social factors behind the choices of diets (what are the social processes that lead people to think about the diet, many may answer as “I want to be healthy or more environmentally conscious” but for sociology the concern is why more people are suddenly concerned with health or become environmentally conscious; what does it tell us about the society now; what forces lead to these attitude changes, etc. So you need to fix your research question asap and send me a new question and a shorter proposal so that you can go on with your research.
