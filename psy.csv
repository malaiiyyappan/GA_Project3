As promised, we have updated the rules and posting requirements for this sub. They can be found on the sidebar in the redesign, but I will also be posting them here for full visibility. The updated rules are as follows:

1. **Do not ask for diagnostic or analytic impressions.** It is unethical to give diagnoses or analyses over the internet. These types of questions are better asked of a therapist in\-person. 
2. **Questions must be asked clearly in the post title.** Violations of this rule will be removed immediately. You may give additional or clarifying information in the body of your post.
3. **Answers must be evidence\-based.** Answers given must reflect the scientific consensus and ideally should cite sources. Anecdotal evidence or pop\-psychology will be removed.
4. **No leading questions.**  Examples of these questions are: ""Why is Group X so stupid?"" or ""What is wrong with Group X?"" 
5. **No jokes, memes, insults, or slurs.**  This is an academic subreddit, and while discussion is encouraged, any  off\-topic or non\-academic comments will be removed. This includes the  use of slang terms or slurs to describe any phenomenon or group of  people. 

Removal of posts and comments is at the sole discretion of the moderation team.

Here are some assumptions I've made based on our current understanding of developmental psychology:

* There is a strong neurological basis for gender
* Being transgender is a result of the brain sexually differentiating to the opposite sex as the body
* Humans develop in a similar manner as other social mammals
* Children have a strong inherent desire to eventually become adults
* The major difference between children and adults is that adults focus primarily on their responsibilities (often including raising children) whereas children focus primarily on learning
* Adulthood is strongly linked to sexual differentiation
* As children and adolescents adopt adult behaviors, this leads to increasing psychological maturity
* Adult behavior varies considerably between the sexes
* Cisgender children are neurologically programmed to recognize adults of their own sex, and learn and adopt their behaviors.

Given this, typical (cisgender) psychological development goes something like this:

* Child recognizes adults of his or her own sex, and gradually learns and adopts their behaviors
* As the child learns how to act like an adult, this leads to increasing psychological maturity
* The more psychologically mature someone becomes, the more their focus shifts from learning, to taking on responsibilities

With transgender people, this process becomes stalled, when social pressures and their body's physical limitations prevent them from adopting adult behaviors of their psychological gender. As a result, they stay in a juvenile state of mind for an extended period of time. This inability to psychologically mature as their birth sex produces gender dysphoria.

Transitioning allows transgender people to learn and adopt the behaviors of the sex that corresponds to their psychological gender, and permits them access to normal psychological development as an adult.

Using this model, there may be other tests for transgender people that don't necessarily look for gender dysphoria. For example, someone might be asked to imagine themselves in the future, both as male and female. Someone who's transgender would likely have a much stronger connection to the sex opposite to their birth sex.

Things like delayed emotional development, and difficulty adopting adult responsibilities might help with diagnosis, in someone who's strongly repressing their gender identity and may not be comfortable discussing it directly.

Inability to mature as their birth sex, combined with a belief that it's impossible to mature as their psychological gender, might lead to extended periods of depression and apathy. This may not be recognizable as gender dysphoria, but could give clues to therapists and clinical psychologists.

Lack of any strong internal motivation could lead to periods of passive behavior and/or recklessness. (don't care, nothing to lose)

These symptoms are frequently described by other transgender people, and could be used to complement, as opposed to replace, the heavy reliance on ""gender dysphoria"" as the sole symptom of being transgender. By describing it as a condition that leads to impaired development if transitioning isn't possible, that could also remove some of the social stigma of being transgender.

I've discussed this hypothesis with other transgender people, and it resonates strongly with them. I've been told repeatedly that this description of transgender psychology has been enormously helpful in allowing them to understand themselves. But since psychological literature on transsexuality seems to be exclusively written from the perspective of outside observers, this has created confusion for many of us. For example, there's currently a rift in the transgender community over whether gender dysphoria is necessary for being transgender, but that seems to miss the bigger picture.

I've tested this explanation by writing statements along these lines and posting them in transgender subreddits. Here's the one I posted in the male-to-female sub:

And in the female-to-male sub here:

Read the comments. It's clear that these statements have resonated *very* strongly among people who've read it.

By describing being transgender strictly in terms of ""gender dysphoria"", that implies that we're just unhappy with our gender. But most of us are unhappy about a lot of things, and have to learn to live with them. On the other hand, if we feel we can't mentally become adults as our birth gender, that's a much more serious problem that needs to be addressed. It also puts the problem in terms that could potentially make society more sympathetic to us.

TL;DR: Children are neurologically programmed to recognize adults of their own sex and emulate them. With transgender people, this gets reversed, which makes it difficult or impossible to emulate the behavior of adults of our psychological gender. This often leads to delayed development, although transitioning can allow us access to normal development as an adult, corresponding to our psychological gender.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about, it&amp;#39;s first necessary to understand human psychological development under typical conditions. Here are some assumptions I&amp;#39;ve made based on our current understanding of developmental psychology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a strong neurological basis for gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being transgender is a result of the brain sexually differentiating to the opposite sex as the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans develop in a similar manner as other social mammals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children have a strong inherent desire to eventually become adults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major difference between children and adults is that adults focus primarily on their responsibilities (often including raising children) whereas children focus primarily on learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adulthood is strongly linked to sexual differentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As children and adolescents adopt adult behaviors, this leads to increasing psychological maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adult behavior varies considerably between the sexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisgender children are neurologically programmed to recognize adults of their own sex, and learn and adopt their behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, typical (cisgender) psychological development goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child recognizes adults of his or her own sex, and gradually learns and adopts their behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the child learns how to act like an adult, this leads to increasing psychological maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more psychologically mature someone becomes, the more their focus shifts from learning, to taking on responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With transgender people, this process becomes stalled, when social pressures and their body&amp;#39;s physical limitations prevent them from adopting adult behaviors of their psychological gender. As a result, they stay in a juvenile state of mind for an extended period of time. This inability to psychologically mature as their birth sex produces gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitioning allows transgender people to learn and adopt the behaviors of the sex that corresponds to their psychological gender, and permits them access to normal psychological development as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this model, there may be other tests for transgender people that don&amp;#39;t necessarily look for gender dysphoria. For example, someone might be asked to imagine themselves in the future, both as male and female. Someone who&amp;#39;s transgender would likely have a much stronger connection to the sex opposite to their birth sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like delayed emotional development, and difficulty adopting adult responsibilities might help with diagnosis, in someone who&amp;#39;s strongly repressing their gender identity and may not be comfortable discussing it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

First post ever on reddit so please if I am breaking any rules, feel free to pm me and i will edit it.

I am a [M.Sc](https://m.sc/) Student (23f) in business psychology and currently in the phase of developing a problem statement for my master thesis. I did my bachelor degree in industrial business economics so the concepts of psychology are relatively new to me (even though im doing business psychology the psychology part has been rather decent so far and i finished most of my courses already).

Fortunely or unfortunately (Im not decided yet) we are given complete freedom for our master thesis so i want my research to be more psychological then taking the business direction since im having way more fun delving into psychological studies. I already did some research for a problem statement and found the following topics to peak my interest:

\- nostalgia (indulging in past events fosters well-being)

\- Perfectionism

\- self-regulation

\- locus of control

\- Effects of compliments

\- Just World Belief (victimization)

I took the approach to read some papers and to look at the future perspectives the authors give to develop my own research question but most of the suggested research require longitudinal studies or data which is not achievable for the scope of my thesis.

Since most of you full-time psychology students have a better understanding of the theories beforehand can you give any advices or inspiration to develop a specific problem statement for my thesis? My study definitely needs to be empirical but otherwise Im not given any restrictions. The aspect which irritates me the most is if my research question has any value for science or society e.g. If i measure the value of nostalgia between generations and shifts towards certain aspects, has this study enough value to stand on his own?

Below is a part of a summary of a book that I read. I’d like to know where I can find more information online about the bold part. Especially the part about how our brain makes a moral shift that causes them to believe they deserve to be hit. Is there a name for this phenomenon?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The first law of human emotion is that *for every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s say that something bad happens to you, like getting punched in the face. At that moment, a *moral gap* opens up between what you think is fair and just and what’s actually happening. Your natural response is as strong as the punch itself - you feel that you’ve been wronged, get angry, and want to close the gap by getting even.  
&gt;  
&gt;But what if you couldn’t? The second law states that *our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time*. **If you kept getting hit and were unable to do anything about it, your brain would begin to compensate; which is essentially what happens to abused children. Unable to close the moral gap, their brains instead make a moral shift that causes them to believe they** ***deserve*** **to be hit.** This happens in all kinds of situations, when people who are unable to act essentially come to see pain as the new normal.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

It is also very discouraging to know that IQ is more than 80% heritable which means the majority of the people in these nations will have people with extremely low IQ for generations and there is no way to increase IQ substantially since it is genetic and genes change very slowly (from what I remember that I read in biology class when I was in school). 

 I heard there is Flynn effect which makes me hopeful but then some people suggest that the rise in IQ is only due to better nutrition. So the overall IQ of people will still be low in developing countries because nutrition doesn't account that much.

To be honest, I feel really miserable. To know that people in developing countries like me are genetically mentally less intelligent is depressing because Intelligence is required in everything.

Here are the assumptions I've made about gender and developmental psychology:

* There is a strong neurological basis for gender
* Being transgender is a result of the brain sexually differentiating to the opposite sex as the body
* Humans develop in a similar manner as other social mammals
* Children have a strong inherent desire to eventually become adults
* The major difference between children and adults is that adults focus primarily on their responsibilities (often including raising children) whereas children focus primarily on learning
* Adulthood is strongly linked to sexual differentiation
* As children and adolescents adopt adult behaviors, this leads to increasing psychological maturity
* Adult behavior varies considerably between the sexes
* Cisgender children are neurologically programmed to recognize adults of their own sex, and learn and adopt their behaviors.

Given this, typical (cisgender) psychological development goes something like this:

* Child recognizes adults of his or her own sex, and gradually learns and adopts their behaviors
* As the child learns how to act like an adult, this leads to increasing psychological maturity
* The more psychologically mature someone becomes, the more their focus shifts from learning, to taking on responsibilities

With transgender people, this process becomes stalled, when social pressures and their body's physical limitations prevent them from adopting adult behaviors of their psychological gender. As a result, they stay in a juvenile state of mind for an extended period of time. This inability to psychologically mature as their birth sex produces gender dysphoria.

Transitioning allows transgender people to learn and adopt the behaviors of the sex that corresponds to their psychological gender, and permits them access to normal psychological development as an adult.

Using this model, there may be other tests for transgender people that don't necessarily look for gender dysphoria. For example, someone might be asked to imagine themselves in the future, both as male and female. Someone who's transgender would likely have a much stronger connection to the sex opposite to their birth sex.

Things like delayed emotional development, and difficulty adopting adult responsibilities might help with diagnosis, in someone who's strongly repressing their gender identity and may not be comfortable discussing it directly.

Inability to mature as their birth sex, combined with a belief that it's impossible to mature as their psychological gender, might lead to extended periods of depression and apathy. This may not be recognizable as gender dysphoria, but could give clues to therapists and clinical psychologists.

Lack of any strong internal motivation could lead to periods of passive behavior and/or recklessness. (don't care, nothing to lose)

These symptoms are frequently described by other transgender people, and could be used to complement, as opposed to replace, the heavy reliance on ""gender dysphoria"" as the sole symptom of being transgender. By describing it as a condition that leads to impaired development if transitioning isn't possible, that could also remove some of the social stigma of being transgender.

I've discussed this hypothesis with other transgender people, and it resonates strongly with them. I've been told repeatedly that this description of transgender psychology has been enormously helpful in allowing them to understand themselves. But since psychological literature on transsexuality seems to be exclusively written from the perspective of outside observers, this has created confusion for many of us. For example, there's currently a rift in the transgender community over whether gender dysphoria is necessary for being transgender, but that seems to miss the bigger picture.

Now that I've stated my hypothesis, the next step would be to design and conduct an experiment, or a study. But with the politically-charged nature of transgender psychology, I feel like this is a third-rail subject in many circles. How might I approach academia with this informal research, and have a chance of being taken seriously?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand gender dysphoria, it&amp;#39;s first necessary to understand human psychological development under typical conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background (if you have the time to read it):

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was pondering the subject of welfare/UBI and thought about an empirical observation I made in my travels through Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that countries with better welfare systems, that is to say, systems that care for the material well-being of those we consider to be lacking objects critical to life (food, shelter, healthcare... etc), don't necessarily have a more contempt or happy population of ""poor"" people. Obviously, this is an empirical observation, I don't state this as a fact, I state it as a very weak hypothesis.

&amp;#x200B;

Some countries with quality welfare systems seem to have a greater amount of ""happiness"", but that often seems to correlate with equality, rather than actual well-being. For example countries like the UK/Ireland/France/Germany compared to countries Denmark/Sweden/Finland/Slovakia, there seem to be much more social discontent among the less wealthy in the former, compared to the later, but their social welfare system aren't that different in terms of the material benefits they provide.

&amp;#x200B;

This assumption, that it's equality rather than objective wealth that makes someone happier, seems to hold up in studying economic theory and human social behavior. That is to say, it's perceived wealth (my wealth compared to my neighbors) and perceived status (my status in whatever hierarchies I care about) that make people ""happier"", rather than absolute wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

Further more, looking at revolutionary movements in the last dozens of years or so, it doesn't seem to be the poorest countries which revolt (as in, countries with a large amount of people unable to afford food, shelter or medicine), but the countries with a large amount of inequality.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any evidence to support the idea that material wealth, rather than relative wealth/status, is a factor for human contempt/happiness ?&lt;/p&gt;

My family has been farmers since at least the 1600s. My dad was a farmer, who passed away after I was born. 

Low-class farming families depend heavily on salvaging anything that is useful, because there is a lot of things and machinery required to succeed with a harvest.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a therapist who's helping me overcome depression. We were working on it for the past half a year or so. Without going into details on how we got there, recently we got into a kind of an argument over the notorious nature/nurture debate on homosexuality. I believe that I had an inborn inclination towards being both gay and submissive (the latter both in terms of BDSM subculture as well as in more general sense of being a docile obedient boy, the opposite of a troublemaker, barely ever punished). He, on the other hand, believes it is nearly exclusively explained by psychology and my childhood. He doesn't want to change my sexual orientation or anything, but he still thinks it's somewhat relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember having a dream about being kidnapped by a grown-up man, tied spread-eagle, and enjoying my helplessness, not wanting it to end even when my parents apparently started banging on the door to rescue me. That was when I was about 3-4 years old. Another thing of note is that I loved rubbing my penis against the bed since about the same time, and I was scolded by my kindergarten teacher and parents for that (I don't think I was ever punished for that in any manner though). In time I learned to stop moving in presence of parents and pretend that I sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist believes that the two are connected, and that the erotic pleasure I got from that dream was caused either by the lack of movement, similarly to how I was pretending that I'm asleep, or from more generalized feeling of experiencing something forbidden. I don't remember clearly, but I actually believe that the dream happened much earlier than I learned to pretend being asleep, so I don't think this is likely. The therapist also keeps insisting that there must be something behind my unwillingness to be rescued in that dream, like I hated my parents, or was afraid of them, or something like that. That sounds rather absurd to me. I did come to dislike them eventually, but that was much later, way into my teens.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, sometime shortly before or maybe even during puberty, my father warned me about the danger of pedophiles. He told me to never take candy from strangers, and that if any man ever tries to put his penis in my mouth, I should bite it and run away. While the specifics of the last part are kind of weird, as my dad can sometimes be, I don't think that being warned about pedophiles by your parents is something out of the ordinary, is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Yet for some reason my therapist believes that receiving a warning like this is very unusual. He thinks that given the utter lack of any information about sex in general and the opposite gender in particular, that information could spark my interest and excite me, pushing me towards ""becoming gay"". I think it kind of did spark my interest, but I believe that the cause and effect here are reversed. At the very least, it *built* upon my erotic feelings towards being helpless and having things done to me, it did not *cause* them.

&amp;#x200B;

While I think it might be possible that the environmental factors could have triggered the extent to which I'm gay, submissive and masochistic, I think that the potential/inclination for these things are inborn (kind of like having a knob that can be turned on by various degrees, if at all) and correlate with particular brain structures, be it genes or prenatal hormones or anything like that. That is reinforced with scientific studies that, while hardly being an absolute authority, seem plausible enough. I concede that particular fetishes are usually environmental, but not these behavioral patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** my therapist thinks I'm gay because my dad planted the idea of having a man's penis in my mouth before I knew what sex is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, do you agree with my reasoning? Are these things inborn?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not ask for any personal therapeutic advice.

The psychologists will usually rely upon various studies that propose arrangements that seem to be presently more focused on the benefits of sharing at least 35% of care by each parent. Currently more traditional notions relating to the desirability of having one home to live in seem to be considered to be outweighed by the ""social capital"" of greater shared care. I have also encountered the notion of parental gatekeeping, being the idea that captures the notion that one parent (usually the mother) will sometimes engage in actions to either encourage or discourage participation in the parenting process by the other parent. This is seen to be a reaction to perceived or actual notions of the need to protect the child's safety.

The psychologists will usually rely upon various studies that propose arrangements that seem to be presently more focused on the benefits of sharing at least 35% of care by each parent. Currently more traditional notions relating to the desirability of having one home to live in seem to be considered to be outweighed by the &amp;quot;social capital&amp;quot; of greater shared care. I have also encountered the notion of parental gatekeeping, being the idea that captures the notion that one parent (usually the mother) will sometimes engage in actions to either encourage or discourage participation in the parenting process by the other parent. This is seen to be a reaction to perceived or actual notions of the need to protect the child&amp;#39;s safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this: Given the reproducibility crisis which seems to be centred particularly in the realm of psychology, how much scepticism should be applied to these types of studies? Should they be considered safe enough, so that psychological reports that rely upon these concepts should be considered to hold significant weight in judicial decision making? &lt;/p&gt;

As far as I understand, there's intrinsic and extrinsic emotion regulation. Intrinsic is when you yourself try to regulate your emotions in some way (e.g. watching a sad film or going for a walk). Extrinsic is when someone else attempts to regulate your emotions (e.g. a mother comforting her child).

With that in mind, is it emotion regulation if emotions from a group cause you to feel those emotions too? For instance, say I've joined a reading group and we're all reading a book I dislike, but the rest of the group loves. When I go to that reading group, I start to actually feel more positively towards the group because they seem so enthusiastic about it, and by the end I actually feel positively towards the book too. Is this extrinsic emotion regulation even though it was intentional?

On a related note, are there any good theories/works on the ways in which emotions spread throughout a group and are to some extent contagious. I'm thinking more in terms of something like cults here. So, for example, if someone in a cult starts hating a specific group in society and then the rest of the cult start to feel this hate too, is that emotion regulation again or is there another theory to explain how emotions are in some way contagious?

Hope all that makes sense! Happy to clarify if needs be :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently become very interested in the concept of emotion regulation whilst researching for my PhD which involves looking at the reasons why people join and remain in certain groups. As far as I understand, there&amp;#39;s intrinsic and extrinsic emotion regulation. Intrinsic is when you yourself try to regulate your emotions in some way (e.g. watching a sad film or going for a walk). Extrinsic is when someone else attempts to regulate your emotions (e.g. a mother comforting her child).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, is it emotion regulation if emotions from a group cause you to feel those emotions too? For instance, say I&amp;#39;ve joined a reading group and we&amp;#39;re all reading a book I dislike, but the rest of the group loves. When I go to that reading group, I start to actually feel more positively towards the group because they seem so enthusiastic about it, and by the end I actually feel positively towards the book too. Is this extrinsic emotion regulation even though it was intentional?&lt;/p&gt;

So the question is the following, sorry in regards to my english:

Lets imagine we have an extremenly logical and inteligent person, IQ over 140 at least, that has ridden a lot of philosophy and searches always for the righteous thing to do.

Now let's imagine he encounters experience in his life that make him believe that this society doesnt reward Justice but rather Might, that he could be more succesful if he let his moral values away and acknowledges that society itself its evil thus being evil its necessary to flourish.

Given the gifted mind of said individual could he just decide to ""well since no one its giving me props for doing this the right way I might as well try my best to be as effective being evil as I can""?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this scenario posible? where a righteous individual ends up as a psychopath manipulating others to his benefit using his gift that was previously set on being fair just and equal with every human being based of the negative input life has given him when he was a good person? Or a psychopath can only be born that way?

I've had this idea for awhile now and have been trying to reach out to reddit/tumblr/kik about the opinions of ED sufferers on the concept of a cat cafe that served ""ED friendly"" food; however I am also worried about potential negative effects of having ""readily available super low cal"" food may have on sufferers. I have been in and out of recovery for anorexia with bulimic cognitions since I was 10 years old, and over the years have amassed many tasty recipes at all the stages of my eating disorder; to help encourage recovery, I would break the menu into 3 sections: 1) lowest possible cal, 2) medium cal, 3) ""normal"" cals for that dish.

The ""cat"" specific part is because I love cats, but also to hopefully give people a calming/""therapeutic"" space, and possibly give people ""a reason"" to go to a place that serves ED friendly food.

One response I got said that it would be beneficial to not market the cafe as an ""ED"" cafe, because it may essentially ""out"" someone. Personally, with the intention of the cafe being to help sufferers, I think it would be more impactful if it was marketed as such, but I also don't know if that *actually* is more helpful.

Another helpful response suggested  engaging the patrons to help them build a sense of community/support, but I have no ideas on how to do that, or what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently just ""testing the waters"", so depending on how the idea is received, I plan on talking to an ED specialist about the concept before continuing forward. I'm sorry if you see this post somewhere else, I really am just trying to get some feedback that is very important to me!

The discussion turned in to her basically saying people who watch those types of videos (death/gore/violence) are psychopaths. They are sick individuals. I disagree say that is not the case. In my opinion, I think people have different ways of digesting information. To me, seeing it makes it more real. Seeing it elicits a stronger emotional response from me and makes me more open to talk about it.  I don’t see anything wrong with it, she does. 

Ultimately, my question is, can anyone share academic research on this topic? Maybe I’m not looking hard enough but I’m not finding anything that shows there is or isn’t any correlation behind ability/interest/desire of watching these types of events and psychopathy or sociopathy.

&lt;p&gt;The discussion turned in to her basically saying people who watch those types of videos (death/gore/violence) are psychopaths. They are sick individuals. I disagree say that is not the case. In my opinion, I think people have different ways of digesting information. To me, seeing it makes it more real. Seeing it elicits a stronger emotional response from me and makes me more open to talk about it.  I don’t see anything wrong with it, she does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my question is, can anyone share academic research on this topic? Maybe I’m not looking hard enough but I’m not finding anything that shows there is or isn’t any correlation behind ability/interest/desire of watching these types of events and psychopathy or sociopathy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

It is my job to know the safety requirements, ratings, etc. Many customers disregard me warning them that what they're trying to do could get someone killed. 

Im not really sure how to explain the ""feeling"" that these customers convey in the way they don't listen, so I'm including an example. 

A piece of equipment we sell has a little package of bolts inside of a tube, seated in one leg of the equipment. It's standard for me to tell the customer something along the lines of ""the bolts are in a little tube in one leg. Make sure you remove them before installation. You can use a little flathead screwdriver to pry them out."" I even have a package removed from the leg that I use to show them what to look for.

I had a customer come in today to purchase one of these pieces of equipment. I go through my whole spiel about the bolts, show him what the package looks like, how to remove it. Not two minutes later, he asks me (his actual words): ""So where do I get the bolts to put it together?"" 

I go through the whole thing again, show him the little package of bolts and explain where they're at and how to get them out. When we're loading the equipment into his truck, he looks down one of legs, sees the bolt package and says:

""What is that?"" 
I explained: ""Oh, those are the bolts I was talking about."" 
Him: ""Well how am I supposed to get them out?""

Now, I understand this is a relatively small thing, certainly not going to be a life and death situation, but I find the more and more I talk with someone who does not listen, especially when I'm trying to make things easier for them, the more I find myself getting frustrated. 

I really want to understand what goes on ""behind the scenes,"" so to speak, with someone like this. The way this is conveyed is almost as if it seems like they're thinking to themselves ""Why would I try to remember, when I can just have you remember for me?""

Hi there everyone,

I'm  in a behavioral neuroscience PhD program along with a friend of mine.  We had a very nerdy and heated debate that I feel like shouldn't really  have been a debate, but I was wondering if I could get some  help/guidance. When it comes to autoshaping, I've always been taught  that it is a Pavlovian response more than an operant one. Every paper I  have looked up refers to it as such -- it is even inherent in the  defintions I've found. Everything I'm seeing points to a Pavlovian  response. My friend is asserting that autoshaping is in no way shape or  form a Pavlovian response based on what he has read (a lot of  behaviorist research ca. 70's). Science has evolved since then, and I  don't think he is taking that into account. I also think he is  conflating autoshaping and shaping as he could not provide a  distinction. I am not an expert in operant conditioning, so I was  wondering if any of you might be able to shed some light on where we're  going wrong: 1. What is an ELI5 definition of autoshaping, and when would  you employ it over shaping? 2. Is autoshaping (or shaping) universally  considered Pavlovian, or is there debate?

I've  seen examples of autoshaping in my quick searches, but I'm not quite  understanding how it fits into the realm of operant conditioning. Could anyone help?

I find Jonathan Haidt's general picture, that morality and religion are group-based adaptations (invoking group selection, though I am aware this is quite controversial) for solving the free rider problem and allowing groups to better cohere, rather persuasive, and I have sometimes wondered whether our group-based adaptations couldn't be harnessed to facilitate cooperation on a global scale.

I've added a few links to give an idea as to what these videos are and I'd really like to know if there is an actual science behind it.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;#39;m trying to do research just as a personal project. To give a background as to what these videos are they are subaudible messages that contain &amp;#39;affirmations&amp;#39; that claim to help to better your life. Some promise you&amp;#39;ll obtain a &amp;#39;positive mindset&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;increase faith&amp;#39; while others promise physical transformations such as &amp;#39;losing weight&amp;#39; or having &amp;#39;paler complexion&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;ve added a few links to give an idea as to what these videos are and I&amp;#39;d really like to know if there is an actual science behind it.  Personally I&amp;#39;m really skeptical about these videos and the only possible explanations I can think of is the placebo effect, but I really don&amp;#39;t have any background in science or psychology so I don&amp;#39;t want to jump to conclusions too. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond to the question! :)&lt;/p&gt;

Your friendly neighborhood mod here. I wanted to make a post asking all of you wonderful people of /r/askpsychology what you all think should be done in the sub. I get the feeling there is a good amount of discontent and disconnect between the mod team and users, I am trying to get rid of this discontent by opening up a dialogue and posing an explanation. 

I must be honest, most of the modqueue is taken care of by /u/NawtAGoodNinja and I commend him for it. But at the same time he is a grown man with a 9-5 job with limited time to be going through the modqueue. He also moderates multiple other subs so dividing his time is necessary. 

For me, I am a student who works when I am not studying. I do the best I can checking out the sub, but I really have a limited amount of time to check the sub, even though I love it here so much. And even when I do have time, most of the queue is already done by /u/NawtAGoodNinja anyway. But that means that some stuff falls through the cracks and is left in the queue for upwards of a day or so. 

You may notice I have said nothing about the other two mods on the list, /u/Burnage and /u/MaxDemian_ and that's because neither of them are active on this sub. At all. So when it comes down to moderation, it is left to me and /u/NawtAGoodNinja. 

Besides the talking about time trouble of moderation, I also wanted to talk about the big pain in the neck about moderating the sub. A lot of people seem to think that their posts are taken out by the spam filter for no reason. But if you guys could see the modqueue, you would realize that about 90% of the posts in there are blatantly breaking rule 1. So there really is a need to have the filter take out all posts then have them approved by either me or Nawt. 

So, I have a few questions (and a statement). You can answer all of them, or none of them, what I am looking for here is feedback. 

* What can be done to improve the sub? 


* What should we do in order to make this the best sub we can? 
     * Ideas that come to mind include: a flair system (for users and posts), a larger moderation team, and/or a remodeling of the sub. 


* I am somewhat new to moderation, does the look of the sub mean anything to you guys? Is the default reddit look passable or should we be looking for someone to spruce things up?  

* Should there be any rules added? Removed? Edited? 

* Any general critiques of the mod team would be much appreciated. I feel there is very little dialogue between users and the mod team, so let your thoughts fly and hit us with some **constructive** criticism. 

I hope you all are enjoying the sub. We get a lot of really good questions and a lot of really good responses, so hats off to everyone... who doesn't break rule 1. 

Warm regards,

I feel like others (including myself) overestimate someone&amp;#39;s skill in a given field they don&amp;#39;t know anything about themselves. For example before delving into computer science myself everybody in this field seemed (to me) to have an unattainable knowledge on this subject. Knowing more about this now, one starts to quickly realize how much is actually not as far away (intellectually) as previously imagined.   &lt;/p&gt;

Evolutionarily, it makes sense that our brains would switch to automatic thought processes whenever they get the chance, since doing so would save us a lot of unnecessary mental exertion.

The goal-tracking application is going to be designed to track goals, tasks/to-dos, emotions associated with completion/failure, and habits of users when pursuing certain goals. My goal is that my target audience (college students and young professionals) pursue ambitious goals, but might fail due to certain negative feedback cycles (emotional distress from failure or bad habits). A majority of this tracking requires daily input from the user to keep tabs on progress, emotions, obstacles.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that the application leverages a lot of user data to produce output, this introduces something called tracking fatigue, which are barriers that prevent users from getting the optimal output due to poor inputs. Some of which include:

* Too much data is required from the user (not enough time or **motivation** to input) resulting in inaccurate output
* Hard for user to interpret how data input correlates to application's output resulting in inaccurate conclusions
* Misinterpreted results based on the aforementioned inaccurate conclusions

&amp;#x200B;

I've created a diagram of the relationship between tracking fatigue and inaccurate outcomes here: [https://plectica.com/maps/LZ9HNIP53](https://plectica.com/maps/LZ9HNIP53) ([https://imgur.com/a/y5JgVwS](https://imgur.com/a/y5JgVwS)) and I believe that the insufficient data, insufficient context, and insufficient understanding can be tackled through how the UI looks/feels, how the application leverages notifications, and how the application presents tracking results, respectively.  


However, I'm curious as to how I can tackle the insufficient engagement issue in tracking fatigue. I started exploring some possible motivations like social influences (having leaderboards), streaks or a coach (think Duolingo), and rewards (praises, etc), but I see a few downsides to each of these. For example, in the example of Duolingo, users have negative emotional responses to having disappointed Duo, or in the example of streaks, users often given up once a large streak is broken under the assumption it's not worth attempting again. I'd be interested if anyone has any resources or insights in how to find the right motivators that would keep a user engaged.

Is much importance placed on where one does their education/training or are all APA accredited schools viewed the same?

Are there many respected online/hybrid training programs? Something where the lecture courses can be done online and the practical application in person. 

Are there any non-academic experiences that schools or employers usually look for? 

What pitfalls/oversights should I avoid while considering and/or pursuing clinical psychology as a degree and career? What are downsides/challenges I should expect?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m strongly considering clinical psychology as a career, but I have little expeience in the psych academic community. I don&amp;#39;t know what qualities and achievements would make me competitive in the job market (or to a university for training). Or what other things I need to consider before returning to school for this. Would anyone be up for answering some questions? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the practical distinction between PhD and PsyD? Do they have roughly the same job prospects? How different are the training programs? &lt;/p&gt;

How do victims view their abusers? 

• Do victims doubt their abuser's actions?
• What is their thought process about their abusers?
• Do they recognize the abuse?
• Can they both love and hate their abusers?
• Do victims ever call their abusers out on their actions?
• Do victims sometimes go against what their abusers demand? (Like hanging out with friends the abuser has told them not to,)
• What makes them try to get out of the abusive relationship?

What is the abuser's viewpoint?

• Do they realize they are abusing their partner? 
• Why do they abuse their partner?
• What are excuses they make for the abuse?
• Do they really love their partner?
• How do they overall feel about their partner?
• What causes them to snap?
• Do they get apologetic for any other reason besides the risk of losing their partner?
• What emotional abuse techniques do they use to harm their partner?


Cycle of Abuse?

• What is an in-depth analysis and some examples?
• How long does the honeymoon period last?
• What's the difference between the apology and honeymoon stages?
• What are examples of the honeymoon phase?

This is mainly for chemically based depression or depression not caused by an outer source , situation or person.

1. Serotonin , with the drugs prescribed mainly for depression it would lead you to believe serotonin is a main factor in depression but a lot have study’s have proved this wrong for a majority of people. In other words new evidence shows that starving someone of nutrients needed to make serotonin have showed results that there is not much is at all a connection with serotonin and depression. Higher serotonin can make some people more depressed by hijacking dopamine and some people respond good to higher levels but levels of it in the brain doesn’t necessarily correspond with mood .

2. Dopamine , the molecule known for goal focused behavior concentration and pleasure is Rarely looked at as being the first line assumption of what causes depression when depression usually (not every time ) causes apathy, loss of concentration , loss of sex drive , no goal focused behaviors , fatigue all symptoms of low dopamine levels and SSRIs given to people with dopamine deficiency can make someone worse in those aspects by the serotonin reuptake Essentially hijack dopamine receptors . Possibly the reason why suicide and worsening depression is a big black label on SSRIs? Not stating this asking for opinions.

3. Hormones , boy this one hits home the worst depression I’ve ever encountered was by messing with hormones and testosterone it brought me to level I didn’t know I could possibly get that low , do you think hormones have a place in psychiatry ? I know if I don’t take my supplements now for low testosterone and higher estrogen prolactin issues ECT. I Can get really down more so than the drop from any dopamine or serotonin reup take inhibitor discontinuation . Thoughts ? 

4 . BDNF, being looked at by new ketamine therapy’s for depression directly correlated with BDNF levels in the brain . Example , most people get a about a week or 2 of relief from a single infusion and that’s the same amount of time that BDNF is raised from such chemicals . I have chronic pain and can attest to Memantine a cheaper medication that works in similar ways to ketamine Definitely helps pain and mood .

I’d love to hear other thoughts and opinions on this considering it’s such a huge problem everywhere. I researched pretty heavily but if anything seems off here please correct me I’m tryin to learn more from professionals in this matter.

So much that the West esp America and the English speaking countries developed this character archetype of the ""rugged individualist"".

However as I read into cultures outside the West, I notice their history involves surviving horrific disasters and quickly recovering from it. Not it may be argued its because of their bee mentality and because their society is clustered together and stratified why Japan could recover quickly, Korea became wealthy, etc.

EXCEPT that even in cases where individuals from these group oriented cultures are separated, they still operate with immense work ethic and resilience, hell often being extremely self-disciplined. An example is the Japanese in WW2 where isolated Japanese soldiers continued following orders and refused to surrender no matter how much they are starving and wounded. Enough that some soldiers have been hiding in a bunker alone for 30 years after the war.

Another example is how in many American Indian tribes, despite an individual getting lost from their home tribe, they are able to survive for years in the wilderness. They can be separated as far as thousands of miles away due to being captured by the slave trade or going on a diplomatic trip and losing their path back, etc. So long as the environment is similar, they survive despite being solo individuals and there are even cases of Indians surviving in drastically different terrain such as a tribe from the MidWest surviving in Florida or Northern Mexico on his own outdoors!

Even if we take out extreme position, individuals are less prone to misbehave for selfish purpose. I remember seeing a video about an obese Hindu starving himself for days for a religious ritual and becoming skinny eventually without the help of other people like family having to enforce a diet or state government locking him up in a medical center.  This Hindu was known to gouge on sweets everyday of his life but he did it as though he was an SF commando! 

Too many e more examples to put that I can type for whole days but this makes me wonder. In the West even if a city's was in risk of getting suffering damages, many people would not have the restraint to do something as simple as a small wrapper in a trash can and too many people despite suffering physical complications gouge on food. Even when offered thousands to remain below the overweight line for a fight like an opponent of Mike Tysons, they still blow it and not even coming close to the deal. Despite how many white people look down on Arabs for refusing to go against groupthink, your typical Arab person has a a far more organized indoor house than your average French man esp in regards to basic stuff like table clutter.  Your average Mexican tolerates far more working terrible working conditions  with low pay than your average Brit-even if the Mexican has adopted the""American dream"" mentality of individual happiness!

Why is it?  With how the West brags about rugged individualism and believes democracy and capitalism motivates people to work harder and have more restraint in life choices, I notice its the opposite with conformist cultures have people with more mental endurance and discipline even when separated from the group! Where as in the government have to enforce laws and offer rewards to get people to do something as simple as throwing away a bottle and many Westerners complain about how hard their life is (even if they are millionaires who don't have to work) despite how the West claims to worship the self-disciplined rugged individualist!

Why is this? how come despite the PR we are given about thinking for yourself and doing the productive thing, conformist cultures on average are far less self-destructive and have far more self-control and individually tougher than your average Joe from cultures emphasizing individualism, self-reliance, and personal happiness as Western humanism espouses?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many times I seen in many Western political publications, history books, and commentaries by Europeans and Americans on the internet, newspaper, magazines, etc that the reason why  group oriented cultures such as the Japanese, Arabs, and Mexicans is that people from these cultures are weak-minded and cannot think for themselves and they always devolve into a rant bragging about how since Westerners (in particular Canadians, Americans, French, and Brits) are so much better is because since they emphasis self-reliance and individualism, people in democratic liberty-based societies have more superior qualities such as work ethic, discipline, mental toughness, willpower, and other qualities involving self-reliance.

&lt;p&gt;Why is it?  With how the West brags about rugged individualism and believes democracy and capitalism motivates people to work harder and have more restraint in life choices, I notice its the opposite with conformist cultures have people with more mental endurance and discipline even when separated from the group! Where as in the government have to enforce laws and offer rewards to get people to do something as simple as throwing away a bottle and many Westerners complain about how hard their life is (even if they are millionaires who don&amp;#39;t have to work) despite how the West claims to worship the self-disciplined rugged individualist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? how come despite the PR we are given about thinking for yourself and doing the productive thing, conformist cultures on average are far less self-destructive and have far more self-control and individually tougher than your average Joe from cultures emphasizing individualism, self-reliance, and personal happiness as Western humanism espouses?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;In the 1970s, the fire of self-esteem began to catch. The mega best-seller The Psychology of Self-Esteem wildly claimed that there wasn’t “a single psychological problem—from anxiety to depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation” that wasn’t the result of low self-esteem. (Later research would prove him entirely wrong.) Nevertheless, the Cult had found its first followers, and by the 1990s and 2000s, membership had mushroomed. Schools completely banned competitive sports, instituted daily “I Love Me” lessons, and chose 30 class valedictorians.

Now I think that she is talking about narcissism. However some commentors have used this to imply that transgender people are mentally ill, and discrimination isnt the cause: 

https://donotlink.it/1JOM
&gt;What madness inspires these people? How much of a sense of failure as a woman do you need to believe you would be better off injecting synthetic hormones and undergoing surgery to become a fake ‘man’?”

Here he correlates low self-esteem as being a 'failure' which isnt really the same.

&gt;Transgenderism is being promoted, on the one hand, as the ultimate in sexual fantasy and, on the other hand, as a magic cure-all for whatever dissatisfaction anyone might have with society’s expectations of what it means to be male or female. The fantasy aspect reflects an envy of the imagined pleasures to be obtained as a member of the opposite sex, while the magic cure-all reflects a self-pity about the abject misery of being “trapped” in one’s biological sex....We know that gender dysphoria has high rates of “co-morbidity” with mental illness, so that their irrational and disordered thought processes prevent these people from being able to evaluate soberly the practical consequences of their decisions

He then quotes someone saying that Transgenders com it suicide en masse, but uses a bad source:

&gt;This absurd theory has become the basis of the “everybody-gets-a-trophy” mentality which now prevails in schools. There can be no special reward for winners, nor any punishment for failure, because this might hurt the self-esteem of the precious little snowflakes. A similar idea underlies the “anti-bullying” interventions in schools, as well as the endless celebrations of “diversity” and “inclusion” as the highest moral ideals. These ideas derived from the Cult of Self-Esteem have influenced “social justice” ideology, which claims that any expression of thoughts that might hurt someone’s feelings are “hate” and “violence” which we are all expected to condemn. It is “hate” to speak critically of obesity or homosexuality, and this attitude of political correctness often takes the form of denouncing “stigma.” You must use slang terms when referring to the mentally ill, because phrases like “lunatic” and “nutjob” contribute to the stigma of mental illness. But doesn’t the stigma exist for a reason? Crazy People Are Dangerous, as I’ve often explained, and irrational behaviors are stigmatized because they are socially harmful.

How? We have shown that discrimination is correlated with suicide risk: https://medium.com/@notCursedE/dear-benshapiro-re-trans-suicides-be483052d97f

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;ve also noticed that when having to do a big bit of delaying gratification on one end of my life - ie. exams are coming up so i have to study for months, i will end up binging on food. how does it work with willpower? and how can we use whatever relationship that exists between the two to our advantage? &lt;/p&gt;

I felt that I was obligated to make this post due to the influx of rule-breaking posts and comments, in order to update you all as to what appears to have happened and what we've done to address it.

As y'all likely know, the rules of this subreddit are intentionally rigid. This is intended to both elevate the level of discussion and interaction on this subreddit and avoid ethical concerns for professionals that interact with non-professionals here. Part of this policy is to automatically filter out all posts initially, and then to approve posts that meet our requirements manually on a regular basis.

To the best of my knowledge, the problematic posts and comments started roughly three weeks ago. After investigating to the best of my ability, it appears that this was caused by the settings for the subreddit's filter being changed. However, there is no evidence that any direct action by any of the moderators caused this change; there is no evidence in the moderation log or the automoderator settings that any change was made to the filter directly.

I can only see two reasons why this change may have occurred.

1. There was a change to the Automoderator settings roughly around the time that the filter appears to have been loosened. However, after poring over those changes, none of the code entered directly affected the strength of the post filter, as stated above. Perhaps one of the other changes incidentally caused the filter to be loosened, but this doesn't seem likely.

2. Reddit implemented a change to the moderation of subreddits associated with the rollout of NuReddit around the time the problem began. This change appears to have introduced a new menu into NuReddit that allows changes to be made to basic subreddit settings. When I first opened this new page on NuReddit, the filter was set to a less-intense setting, despite the filter being set appropriately on Classic Reddit. After mucking around with those settings, it now appears that all settings on NuReddit match those on Classic Reddit.

Whatever the reason for the change, the filter appears to be back in working order now. I'll be checking the posts that are let through more actively in the future, in case this sort of thing happens again. 

Thanks for being patient with us. Any questions can be posted to the comment section here.

""Another way in which behavior is controlled, or in which control is attempted, is through punishment. Skinner believed that the effectiveness of this technique is limited and that generally it is an undesirable means of control. He defined two cases of punishment, both occurring as a consequence of behavior. In one case a negative reinforcer is presented after a response, and in the other case a positive reinforcer is removed after a response. The first case can be illustrated by some common situations: slapping or scolding a child for misbehavior, berating a worker who has made a mistake, or fining a driver who has violated the speed limit. Examples of the second case include taking away a teenager's driving privileges for 'talking back,' sending a child to his or her room during dinner for displaying bad table manners, deducting money from an employee's paycheck for being late, or walking away from a person who brings up a topic you don't want to talk about.""

This is a very confusing paragraph for me. I'm wondering if the author is using the term ""negative reinforcer"" correctly. If he is, it doesn't fall in line with what I hitherto understood it to mean. As I understand it, a negative reinforcer (a) removes something and (b) ends up increasing the behavior. In punishment, you're trying to decrease behavior, not increase it. That much can be assumed, no? Is he talking about the punisher's behavior? I don't think so. I'm not even sure I understand the difference between ""presenting"" a negative reinforcer and ""removing"" a positive one. He means removing what is USUALLY a positive reinforcer (e.g., the paycheck example). Thus punishment. Fine, I get that one (is that right?), but I still don't get ""presenting a negative reinforcer,"" at least not when put together with the examples he gave (slapping a child? how is that a negative reinforcer?) and with what I previously understood the term to mean.

Help??????

&lt;p&gt;This is a very confusing paragraph for me. I&amp;#39;m wondering if the author is using the term &amp;quot;negative reinforcer&amp;quot; correctly. If he is, it doesn&amp;#39;t fall in line with what I hitherto understood it to mean. As I understand it, a negative reinforcer (a) removes something and (b) ends up increasing the behavior. In punishment, you&amp;#39;re trying to decrease behavior, not increase it. That much can be assumed, no? Is he talking about the punisher&amp;#39;s behavior? I don&amp;#39;t think so. I&amp;#39;m not even sure I understand the difference between &amp;quot;presenting&amp;quot; a negative reinforcer and &amp;quot;removing&amp;quot; a positive one. He means removing what is USUALLY a positive reinforcer (e.g., the paycheck example). Thus punishment. Fine, I get that one (is that right?), but I still don&amp;#39;t get &amp;quot;presenting a negative reinforcer,&amp;quot; at least not when put together with the examples he gave (slapping a child? how is that a negative reinforcer?) and with what I previously understood the term to mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help??????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks :) &lt;/p&gt;

Could also be that being in love masks the 'bad' behaviour of everybody. Therefore it is possible that the internet strangers just were 'blind' for the behaviour.

Long story short, I was physically and emotionally abused 'till my adolescence by my parents, never had friends, the internet was my only friend (and still is). I was constantly bullied and humiliated at school, I was a bookworm, didn't get good grades but I liked reading literature, I liked experimental music and ""different stuff"", I was the ""weird"" nerd guy. Never got into religion, I realized I was an atheist at a young age.

Turned 18, discovered alcohol and prostitutes. Turned 20, discovered drugs. Fast forward now, 24, almost 25 by some months, and I've struggled with heavy alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, anxiety, insomnia, occasional psychosis, been to the psych ward for drug-fueled psychosis, been to rehab, have had seizures due to withdrawals or using, have attempted suicide and pussied out twice, I constantly go sober and relapse, back and forth. I'm a very aggressive person that hates everyone. Professionally I'm an accountant and auditor, started young in Big 4, made it to senior, I make decent money and have a ""senior"" position at a relative young age. Everyone tells me I am very smart, from co-workers, bosses, to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists. Doctors/psychologists even tell me I am a living walking text-book case. My hobbies are that I play lots of instruments and make music as a hobbie, and I enjoy powerlifting.

Now, my question is, what's really in your head when you see a patient like me? I go to psychiatrist A, B and C and I explain them my life and my situation and they just look at me like I'm hopeless, like I am destined to die by suicide, overdose or disease caused by substance abuse; and they just feed me pills. I speak to psychologists and they explain to my I have these ""cognitive impairments/biases"" (I don't remember the specific terminology, but it encompasses things like generalization, self-fullfiling prophecies, pygmalion effect, self-defeating prophecy, etc) and I understand that, but I see the fear and pity in their eyes when they look at me or hear me, again, like I'm hopeless.

So what's really in your head when you see a ""me"" in front of you? That I don't want to comply? That it's the drugs? That I'm wasting your/my time? That I am doomed? Genuinely curious. Again, I'm not looking for self diagnose or ""online therapy"", just genuinely curious about my question. I feel like I'm not breaking any rules, so please don't delete this post.

As a patient, I feel like therapists (psychiatrists or psychologists) stop taking me serious when I mention I am an alcoholic or a drug addict. Like, they don't believe me when I describe my severe depression and suicidal thoughts, or that I've had them since I was a kid, before I became an alcoholic/drug addict. I remember when I was a kid I had an obsession with fire and I would set fire on random stuff, my parents then started hiding lighters and matches and I forgot about my obsession with fire. Then I just became addicted to videogames and the internet.

I can&amp;#39;t stay mad at her longer than an hour for refusing sex but I probably will go crazy sometime in future due to lack of sex... its almost always on my mind now. I don&amp;#39;t think once a month for a couple is normal???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know of men who treat their wives like trash and won&amp;#39;t think twice before forcing themselves upon their wives which is marital rape and again, no law against it here. Me? being all gentle man&amp;#39;y here is the problem? Someone please help. If you have any questions, ask and I will answer but please help me get through this.&lt;/p&gt;

Odd question but after some self reflection and looking back on current and previous relationships i have discovered that i have an innate desire to be needed by those around me. Whether that be acquaintances, close friends, partner or family i feel most validated and confident in myself if they have a problem that i can discuss and help solve with them. during conversation i actively look out for subtle hints and clues as to areas of which a person is hurting and/or insecure of and when i spot something it becomes a goal of mine to help them with whatever this issue may be. I don't force it down their throats and simply explain that i have noticed this may be a problem of theirs and invite them to talk about it if they wish to. I enjoy listening to them and offering practical solutions that can help the situation, however, i am also aware that i use this to validate myself. When somebody is speaking to me about issues i feel useful, wanted and confident in myself.

When all is resolved i find there is a period of bliss where we have worked as a team and come through the other-side together. However this period is short lived and i begin to feel as if there is now a disconnect between myself and the person. Even if that person expresses an interest to spend time with me or they make plans that they feel will make me happy (and on paper they should as they fit in with my interests) i feel a lack of control or validation in the situation and so detach from the event/ person until another problem arises ( which is often caused from this detachment self-fulfilling prophecy i know).  Recognising this has not solved much for myself as i lack the knowledge and skills capable to begin self validating and just being happy to be in a non- tumultuous situation.  I am not looking for a diagnosis but merely would like to know what are some proven techniques that i, myself, could undertake to help resolve this. Having researched i have looked into DBT, mindfulness practices and mood logs to assist in this, so my question is are there any other practical techniques that i can employ to aid in my progression?

Side note: i understand therapy is a no-brainer for this type of problem however financially it is not viable at this current time.  Also i am new to this sub-reddit, if this is the wrong place to ask such a question please could you point me in the direction of where this question would be better suited.

I've known them for many years,  but never got close until recently.

Recently they have been going through a breakup that seems to be the final stage of a long term on again off again relationship. Both parties in this relationship were upset with the other over infidelity. According to this person they broke fidelety in response to being cheated on. Its important to note that I was/am friends with both parties.

The friend in question has shown what I see to be significant interest in maintaining at least a friendly relationship.

This person has been known for reckless and impulsive behaviors and they frequently drink.

The other night I received a call from this person very late at night. They seemed extremely energized and very talkative. They said they had been thinking of me recently and were excited to tell me that they had gotten out of the house / their recent mood slump. They proceeded to tell me about their night - going out for a few drinks- meeting a someone who was new to town - and over all having a fun time. 

They continued to tell me about other things that were going on in their life including a story about what they had done earlier in the day.  They seemed to stop mid story and change what they were saying. Basically it didn't seem to add up. Maybe this doesn't even matter. 

They asked if I wanted to hang out in the morning and go to a park - then asked if I wanted to come over tonight. I told them it was late - not tonight,  but we could go do something in the morning.

HERE'S THE WEIRD PART

The excitement continued to be audible in their tone and speech pattern and they repeated the statement below almost word for word twice with a few stories in between each repetition. This makes a total of THREE repetitions in the course of 30 minutes. 

They said [paraphrasing]: 

1. I have been thinking about you randomly.

2. I'm excited to have gotten out of the house and my dark mood.

3. I went out for a few drinks and met this restaurant owner who was new to town.

This is the same story. Told to me 3 times in 30 minutes.  

I realize the alcohol may have played a role in this behavior,  but I am trying to figure out if there may be any other reasons for the excited speech. 

ANOTHER ODD BIT is that the excited speech patterns seemed to wear off after about 45 minutes of conversion.  

Any insights would be helpful!

Suppose that you are taken to a building and given several hours to walk around.  There are some small rooms and some big rooms, and you generally (unintentionally) memorize the layout of the building.  In other words, if asked, you could draw a rough map of the building on paper, point out where there are small rooms, and where there are big rooms.

However, suppose also that this building was designed in such a way that, if you were to draw the rooms on paper, and read out which rooms were large and which were small going left to right, the sizes of the rooms formed a secret code.  Example: ""LSLSSLS"", where L is a large room and S is a small room.  But to you, none of this has any significance because you are not aware that the sizes of the rooms matter in any meaningful way.  

Now imagine a stranger, knowing that the arrangement/sizing of the rooms form a code, comes up to you and asks you to draw a map of the building.  You still remember the layout so you draw it.  The stranger leaves and you think nothing of it beyond the fact that you just drew a map for someone.  You have now transferred *data you never knew you possessed*.  If someone came up to you and demanded to know what the secret code is, you'd have no idea what they're talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time posting anything on here, so I don't really know what to expect.

I know my question is really weird but it's becoming a very serious issue in my life. 

I wouldn't mind if I forgot some minor things like my keys or my wallet at certain places, but since this poses a serious threat to me, I need to understand how and why I unconsciously do this.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, I just don't turn the stove off, and its the weirdest thing ever for me since I have never had anything similar happen before. I have done this probably more than 10 times by now over the course of a couple of months. Its always in the night time this happens, and I usually go back to my pc with my food to continue my work.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I have changed in my life over the recent months is that I have gotten a new job that imposes a lot of stress and needs me to be on edge 24/7. My sleeping pattern has gotten a bit messy and I usually go to bed in the early hours of the morning and wake up again around noon. Having that said I am still getting my 8hrs of sleep in. I am not trying to answer my own question here, but to give some sort of rational explanation of what I think may have caused this. I am a young male in my early twenties in a perfectly healthy condition.

&amp;#x200B;

If any more info is needed I will try and provide the best I can. Do you guys have any tips on how I can reverse this bad habit? Have you heard any similar stories? And did you find a solution?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot! (If this question is out of place, I am really sorry but this is the first thing I thought off when asking for help, again thanks for taking the time to read this far!)

I am a 27-year-old agnostic who grew up in a fundamentalist religious environment. I used to believe my hallucinations were visions of another spiritual realm. But now I am curious to learn more about the scientific explanations. 

I have read a scientific study about how small children who experience stress or sleep deprivation are much more likely to have hallucinations. 

I definitely fall into that category because my parents fought bitterly with each other throughout my childhood. And they were immigrant parents who worked late and could not afford to hire a babysitter. When I was a small child I would stay with them at their store until they closed at 10 PM. So I wouldn't go to bed until at least 11 PM. 

That could explain most of the hallucinations. But there are a few that I still cannot explain scientifically. 

 The hallucinations were very vivid and somewhat frequent when I was a small child. (Small green people walking around; a white shadow walking across the living room and exiting out of the front porch; floating symbols that might resemble an ancient language). 

I was always shocked and frightened when the hallucinations came because they would appear suddenly without warning. But they never lasted more than a few minutes. Most of the time they only lasted a few seconds. 

The hallucinations were never recurring except one, a rabbit creature with long teeth that glowed in my parents' bedroom. I could only see this one at night in the dark. I saw it every night for years. I was very disturbed by it at first but I became desensitized to it after a while because it never moved or seemed to have any effect on our lives. 

And once, in the second or third grade, my best friend and I had a similar hallucination at the same time. We were playing outside when she suddenly ran into her apartment. I began to follow her, and as I looked to my right I saw a giant white head sinking into the ground. It had the face of an old man and he was laughing. 

Inside, I told her what I saw and she started crying franticly. She kept repeating, ""How did you know that's what I saw?"" 

Well it was not exactly what she saw. She said she saw a regular lifesize old man dressed in white who was smiling and waving at her. But he was not sinking into the ground. She ran into the apartment because she was frightened by him. 

I'm fairly certain she was not making this up because years later, even as adults, she will sometimes ask me, ""Do you remember that time when we both saw that old man ghost?""

For me, the hallucinations disappeared all together around the fourth grade. It was a relief to finally stop seeing them. 

I didn't see anything for years until one night in the seventh grade, I was sleeping over at another friend's house and I suddenly saw a girl swaying in front of her bed. Unlike the earlier visions, this hallucination was very hazy and unclear, like a TV channel with a bad antenna. I could only see she was wearing a sweater or shirt with stripes and she had curly hair. But I could not see her face or what color her clothing was. This was the most frightening hallucination I have ever had because I hadn't had one in so long, and this one didn't go away for maybe an hour or two. 

That was the last big thing I ever saw. Well, I no longer see anything remotely close to the vivid stuff I saw as a child. But sometimes, in the dark when I can't fall asleep at night, I will still see faint shapes and patterns moving around. Like psychedelic patterns. Again, always only in dark during night time. I could see these psychedelic patterns in the dark ever since I was a small child. But they do not appear suddenly. They are simply always there. 

 So most of these examples can be explained by the fact that I was likely stressed and not getting enough sleep. 

 But what about the recurring rabbit? And the old man that my friend and I saw at the same time? And the psychedelic patterns that I can still see? 

FYI I have never taken any drugs except weed, and that was only twice my entire life. And I have low blood pressure so that might affect blood flow to my brain?

Scientific consensus about brain training was that it just makes you good at the games you are playing. The skills won't reflect into improving real world skills. It won't even help improve closely related tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

For example if you practice a game where you remember a sequence of digits you will learn exactly that. It won't help you remember lyrics to a song or remember your shopping list.

So, the common advice was that if you want to improve a specific skill. Eg: chess, programming, math, cooking etc. Just practice doing that instead. It will make you good at it. Brain training is a waste of time.

# London Taxi Cab Study

It is found that in London Taxi cab drivers the part in the hippocampus that involves remembering streets and directions became larger after several years in the profession. But overall hippocampus size was not changed. So, the improvement came at a cost of something else.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As would be expected, they were better at memory tasks involving London landmarks than the non-cabbies, but this advantage appeared to come at a price, as the non-cabbies outperformed them in other memory tasks, such as recalling complex visual information.

# Posit Science and Professor Merzenich

Then comes this new company called Posit Science (BrainHQ)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.brainhq.com/welcome](https://www.brainhq.com/welcome)

&amp;#x200B;

This company is trying very hard to distance themselves from the likes of CogMed and Lumosity by claiming that their games are based on actual science. The main scientist involved in this is Michael Merzenich. Reading his bio it's evident that he is really a very distinguished neuroscientist in the scientific community.

# Criticism of their claims to improve attention

**Double Decision**

A study they site most often is the ACTIVE study. It made participants play a game called Double Decision. A vehicle pops up in the center of the screen. At the same time a sign appears at the edge of the screen. Then you are given two vehicles out of which you have to select the one that appeared at the center and also pick the spot where the sign appeared. It trains you to focus at two things at the same time. The study claims that in the portion who played the game car accidents where the person is at fault reduced by around 40%.

&amp;#x200B;

# Criticism of their claims to improve memory.

For games that claim to improve things like memory I didn't find any such long term studies. And I don't feel how they are any different from the ones from Lumosity and Cogmed. I will explain this with some example games.

&amp;#x200B;

**To-Do List Training**

You hear a audio recording.

""Pick up the hammer , then the saw, and then the mat...""

""Once you pick up the mat, then pick up the ball and the screw..""

You have to remember this and press on buttons corresponding the items.

[https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/do-list-training](https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/do-list-training)

&amp;#x200B;

The items to remember are the same when the game progress. So how do we know that simply we get good at remembering these specific items. For example what I do is I forget the sentences and remember the items only.

hammer, saw, mat...

So, this games makes me good at remembering a series of words.

&amp;#x200B;

**Syllable Stacks**

Same as above but with sounds instead of sentences.

[https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/syllable-stacks](https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/syllable-stacks)

&amp;#x200B;

**Memory Grid**

There are cards when you click on one you hear a sound. You have to match the cards with the same sound. A variation of this game was there in my black and white nokia 1100 15 years ago.

[https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/memory-grid](https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/memory-grid)

Similar criticism as above.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene Crasher**

You are shown items on the table for a brief time. Then it's shown again. You have to pick the item that was not there the first time.

[https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/scene-crasher](https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/memory/scene-crasher)

&amp;#x200B;

What I do is I remember a  pattern in which the items appear. In the second image I see if the pattern is deviated. Sometimes it's just a hunch. How often a scenario like this have any practical application? Someone shows me a picture or a board with text and immediately after shows me another similar one and asks me to spot the difference?

&amp;#x200B;

So, in these games I don't see how you are not just improving in the game.

You get good at remembering a combination of same words.

You get good at remembering a combination of some sounds.

You get good at finding which item was missing from a picture.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final thoughts on BriainHQ

As most people I trust scientific opinion. Reputation of Professor Merzenich is crucial factor for me to give BrainHQ a try. Once  my psychologist suggested CogMed but because of lack of evidence I was very keen on it. Those companies prey on the vulnerable people desperate to improve their cognitive function. Tricking them into thinking they are improving when they are just getting good at the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought BrainHQ was different and actually based on science. My main focus is to improve both my long term and short term memory. I'm a programmer by profession and it would really help me if I could do this. Learn new technologies faster. Remember a function I read in a different file 10 seconds ago etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I admit that the ACTIVE study looks legitimate. But it is about a game out of their 20 other games. But it feels disingenuous to use this to push other games that promises to improve other faculties like memory. Games that might not have the same evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I wasting time and money on this trying to improve my memory? Am I better off with just learning programming in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope a scientist working for BrainHQ sees this and is able to clarify my doubts and concerns.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Scientific consensus on Memory Training&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific consensus about brain training was that it just makes you good at the games you are playing. The skills won&amp;#39;t reflect into improving real world skills. It won&amp;#39;t even help improve closely related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you practice a game where you remember a sequence of digits you will learn exactly that. It won&amp;#39;t help you remember lyrics to a song or remember your shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company lumosity was fined by the FDA for false advertising. The company CogMed which was even recommended by psychologists earlier is now unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;

and in the week the project launched i didn’t sleep for 2 days before the launch 

i don’t remember the launch at all 

following the launch i experienced a few delusions or hallucinations, where i went to my office believing that the director of the organisation i made the project for had asked me to re-do my work because the shards of blood would affect the customer experience

i then realised the launch was days ago and that there were no shards of blood in the project (the whole scenario was not at all within the realm of possibility) 

i’ve had a couple of things like this but nothing unsafe

since then i’ve been experiencing déjà vu every day, but not quite. it feels like a déjà vu, like the feeling of something recurring, but it’s actually a memory of a dream (some things i know i dreamed and other things ‘feel’ like a dream but was something i never dreamt) when i experience these false memories they tend to over come my experience, so i will zone out for a moment and i will re live the dream and not be very aware of my surroundings, it then takes a lot of mental focus to come back to reality, and most times that i do this i feel dizzy / nauseous afterwards 

the nausea tends to last for a few hours after one of these episodes and i will continue to feel unsteady and also in this period after a hallucination whist i still feel nausea i will be more likely to have another hallucination

I jist consider the topic interesting and ask about ideas and general info. 

Hello, I would like to ask about my own situation about which I would love some ideas:

I suspect I have more of a REM stage than normal. I dream a lot, and I mean a lot, and more often than not I remember multiple dreams, one being the rare minimum. I also have hard time waking up, feeling partly dreaming and often confused by the combination of reality and dreams, leaving me very tired. I really feel like it’s the dreams that exhaust me. How do I know whether my REM sleep levels are alright or not, what may be the causes and what do I do about it?

Side note: I also experience the minor control of own dreams (lucid dreaming, is it?), a few times during “early” dreams and quite often during the last dream of the night. 

During my childhood, I suffered from frequent nightmares - I was “aware” of myself during them but not necessarily aware of being it a dream, and they were always abstract - no serial killers or gore, always some kind of abstraction. It will not make much sense but I always had a very intense and anxiety-causing feeling of failing, things not being right and most importantly inaccurate. 

Two types of dreams repeated and represented like 80 % of the nightmares. One was being lost in a maze (which didn’t feel material, more of a feeling) and after finally figuring the way out, being forced to “stir” some substance (like you would stir a soup in a cauldron) and inevitably failing stirring it precisely which would leave me scared for life and waking up horrified. The second one was even more abstract, I felt like hanging in a void, figuring out a perfect balance between two “sizes”. Hard to imagine but I just had to compare two “matters”, putting them in balance and of course failing the task eventually, leading to feeling scared, threatened and waking up. 

The nightmares “didn’t want me” to wake up, I always had to really try hard to realize it was just a dream and wake up. However, I am aware of no mental disorder or OCD but what the hell do I know. Today I am 21, no nightmares but sometimes during falling asleep I sort of feel a sign of one, to which I respond by stopping the process of falling asleep and start again, sleeping well afterwards. Since it kind of isn’t an issue anymore, I am just curious. 

TL;DR: 1) I think I have more REM than normal. How do I know? 2) Used to have weird nightmares. 

Two likely different topics but maybe related? What do I know. Does anybody have similar experience or a suggestion? Much obliged.

He would have them draw pictures or color and their work would be reflective of things on their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video was from a lecture and seemed to be from the 80s or 90s.  I think he had a beard and maybe glasses. He probably has a few books out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry I can’t give too much more information. The class was about 10 years ago. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on an assignment for a clinical psychology class where I'm asked to formulate and develop a study to conduct if funding were not an issue (but ethics still matter). This is part of a term paper due at the end of the semester but I have an annotated bibliography to complete that is supposed to focus on the same research question. The only catch is that it has to be related to my topic for the term which is schizophrenia.

I'm having some trouble at this stage with formulating a structured hypothesis but I know some key areas of interest I want to touch on. So far I'm interested in the association between smoking rates among schizophrenics, I was thinking maybe something along the lines of smoking motivations or smoking cessation in schizophrenics vs the general population.

I was also interested in using early childhood adversities (namely parental separation) as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia with a comorbid substance use disorder or with an arrest for a violent crime or something but I'm having some serious trouble formulating exactly what it is that I want to say.

Any help with hypothesis formulation or articles (no more than 10 years old) would be greatly appreciated!

Essentially you break your life into multiple epochs (Childhood, Elementary school, high school, your 20s, 30s, etc). Then you write about multiple experiences that shaped that epoch, for example tenth grade in the high school epoch, and then you write your analysis of the effects that had on your life. 

My autobiography was roughly 27 pages of content, but contained my *whole life*, including all past traumas. It's me on pages.

I wanted to go to therapy to help sort things out that I couldn't do on my own. If I have a problem prescribe some form of therapy: meditation, CBT, whatever, and I'll do it. If you have questions we'll answer them together. The reasons for this:

1. Money. I'm very poor and time is money. I need to expedite this process as much as possible. I consider what I'm doing as a heavily needed investment into the future, but I have to think about what I am spending.

2. I want the therapy sessions to be more guided and concise than me just droning on; which I typically tend to do at times. I don't have a problem talking and have taken an oath to myself to be as honest and open as I possibly can be in therapy. 

I offered to pay my therapist in their time to read this autobiography, they were hesitant, and their reasoning made sense to a degree. I do admit it is a rather strange request. They said they do better by getting to know a person by talking. She even gave me some insights in therapy.

She did have other reasons to; which were valid; however I can't see passing up to get to the core of who someone is immediately.

I'm trying to get insight as to what to do here. Is it possible that this is just such a crazy request that I shouldn't expect any therapist to do this? Should I just not expect any therapist to do that?

I'm a little worried that I'm going to dish out money I don't have to talk about things that are just in this autobiography.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did an autobiography exercise that is backed academically. Essentially you break your life into multiple epochs (Childhood, Elementary school, high school, your 20s, 30s, etc). Then you write about multiple experiences that shaped that epoch, for example tenth grade in the high school epoch, and then you write your analysis of the effects that had on your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My autobiography was roughly 27 pages of content, but contained my &lt;em&gt;whole life&lt;/em&gt;, including all past traumas. It&amp;#39;s me on pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go to therapy to help sort things out that I couldn&amp;#39;t do on my own. If I have a problem prescribe some form of therapy: meditation, CBT, whatever, and I&amp;#39;ll do it. If you have questions we&amp;#39;ll answer them together. The reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money. I&amp;#39;m very poor and time is money. I need to expedite this process as much as possible. I consider what I&amp;#39;m doing as a heavily needed investment into the future, but I have to think about what I am spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want the therapy sessions to be more guided and concise than me just droning on; which I typically tend to do at times. I don&amp;#39;t have a problem talking and have taken an oath to myself to be as honest and open as I possibly can be in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I'm 22 years old and I have been diagnosed with anxiety. The thing is that I don't know if she is doing things right.

While I did improve my situation, I still feel stuck, and I don't know if I'm actually moving foward.

The things that I don't feel like she is behaving professionally are that first of all, she was my father psychologist for years prior treating me. I feel like she had her mind set about my mother before I even started being treated. And with my father as well.

Since my father is the one that is paying my sessions, and knew her, he asked her about me sometimes, and while she didn't got into specifics about me, she still talked with him. And sometimes, he goes with her as her patient.

She uses herself and her daughters a lot as examples of what could be done or whats a correct aproach to certain matter.

Sometimes I feel like she is a little ""aggressive"" (not in a violent way) when I do something that I shouldn't have done, or when I could have done things in a different and better way. For example, the other day I got frustrated with my dad over whatsapp and got annoying by his questions about my plans for this year (got frustrated because 1 week prior, we talked that when he came back from his vacation, we will meet and talk stuff). I responded to him saying that he was annoying me. Well, when I tell my psychologist about this, knowing that I didn't handle things the best way, she said something like ""Oh come on...!"" (it was in spanish so I don't know the correct translation to the expression so I go with something similar). And we procceeded to ""disucuss"" what should I have answered, me disagreeing with her because I felt like she was asking me to be perfect. I feel like instead of ""teaching"" me what to answer, she should ask me why did I answer like that, and stuff like that.

Other times she starts talking about stuff that I don't really care, giving me examples about stuff that are not completely related to what my problems, and given how I am, I don't feel like cutting her off.

Other thing is that I have been pretty much isolated in my house for like 4 years. Lots of times I feel really depressed, and I do not receive a diagnose from her part. The only thing that she diagnosed is me having anxiety, and she mostly says it like it's just fear.

Do you think that I should change pychologist? I always felt like there are some big no no in the way she works.

Thanks.

With that, lets get on with it.

The TLDR is this : why is it that Western Psychology and Science seems to largely ignore the unfathomable amount of research and observation done by Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, etc... into the consciousness, concentration, insight, and reality?

Okay here is the longer read. 
I am a studied scholar and meditation practitioner whose specialty lay within the schools of Zen and Vajrayana Buddhism, but you could say in general I am a Buddhist specialist ranging from Madyamaka to Pure Land to Dzogchen to Theravada having dedicated the last decade or so of my life to the practice and study of meditation and this tradition/ method of inquiry into consciousness. 

As well, though I would not at all consider myself a specialist in these things, have studied to a degree the methods of the various schools of the Hindus, the Taoist, the Gnostics, etc... and have found them as well to be incredibly useful in understanding the inner mechanism of our reality and consciousness on more than merely and material level. 

In all of this however, whenever I attempt to look into what Western Science and psychology has to say on these matters all I find is an outright rejection of their discovers becuase they deal with matters that are not in the realm of the material. I have found the writings of the Jungians to be of some use as well as others, but by and large these aspects of consciousness and its exploration are largely denied, ignored, or squashed. 

Why do you think this is? Why is it that that western Psychology and Science turn what seems to be a blind eye to what is (if we are to include the methods and inquiry found within the Upanishads and the Shamans before them) to 5,000 years of methodological research and study on our conscious experience and exploration of the mind?

**Original Post:**

## I think I am having a very real breakdown right now.

Let me start by saying I am a 31 year old female. I was feeling incredibly anxious this morning, so much so that I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack, so I called out of work. Not the first time, also not a big deal, my boss was awesome and told me to feel better soon. My boyfriend left for work, and I went into a full fledged anxiety attack. For the first time, I recorded my voice and talked aloud about the feelings I was feeling, and how I have always felt like I don't deserve anything I have from my (relatively) healthy body, to my incredible boyfriend, to my ridiculously easy job that everyone says I am amazing at (they also say that my job is NOT easy, but we'll get to that).

It was the first time in my life I had ever said those things aloud. As I was saying it aloud I became paranoid that my neighbors/landlord would hear me saying those crazy things and find grounds to kick me out of my beautiful apartment. There is ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL WAY that they could hear. I finished up the recording in a whisper and started pacing around wildly, then, out of nowhere, I jokingly accused myself of having Imposter Syndrome. I vaguely remember talking about it in one of my Psych classes in college, and it was a hashtag joke/humble brag that I had heard before too. Then it dawned on me... Maybe I do have it. I read most of the Wikipedia article, sobbing hysterically and pausing multiple times to pace around and scream into pillows.

I have felt like an imposter since I first went to Kindergarten. I have a really good memory (OR SO OTHER TELL ME, I DON'T BELIEVE IT) and I remember not feeling this way before Kindergarten, but constantly after. I am freaking out at the idea that I may not actually be an imposter. I don't think that I deserve even the DIAGNOSIS of Imposter Syndrome, I mean, other people must have it worse than me, I don't probably have it that bad, or I am just trying to get attention.... WHICH ARE ALL THOUGHTS INDICATIVE OF THE SYNDROME. I feel like I have been on the lam my whole life and just found out no one has been looking for me. ~~I'm worried I'm overreacting~~ &lt;--- I have typed this at least 15 times so far, then deleted it. I am in full fledged crisis right now going back and forth between realizing I may not be an imposter and accusing myself of faking Imposter Syndrome.

I am not a danger to myself, I will not harm myself. But I am definitely in crisis. The half of me that is still convinced that I am faking this will not let me reach out to my boyfriend or my state's mental health hotline. The other half of me needs to calm the fuck down and it seems as though the best way to do this is to lean in to it by talking about it. I am SO SCARED THAT I WILL BE FOUND OUT that I created a throwaway email address on my boyfriend's computer (not my computer) to start this throwaway reddit account with so that their is the lowest chance of anyone knowing it is me. I'm going to be brave against my better judgement and tell you all that I even put the grammatical error in my throwaway reddit username to even further mask myself, as I am known in my personal life for proof-reading and proper grammar and anyone who actually knew me would never suspect it is me. That being said, I will not proof read this post, as I am struggling too hard to get it out, and proofreading it may make me change my mind about posting it.

I have also felt like an imposter in EVERY aspect of my life since I was 6 years old, not just at school, or at work. I have felt like I cannot be my parent's child, that I must have been switched at birth. I have even refused to take those genealogy tests just in case it is discovered that I'm not theirs (I look exactly like a combination of both my parents). I am constantly talking about my problems, feelings and my ex-husband with my boyfriend (I am in absolute awe that he does not dump me due to this) because I cannot believe that he can still love me despite my flaws and divorced status, and I keep trying to show him what a faker I am so that he can go find someone who DESERVES how amazing he is. He listens like a saint, holds me as I cry and just tells me that he hopes someday I can see myself how he sees me, and that he isn't going anywhere. I try to tell him that it isn't low self esteem, I am genuinely just tricking him into staying with me because I love him and selfishly don't want him to be unhappy and leave me. So I try to make him as happy as possible. He has tried to tell me, ""That is what love is!"" and ""Everyone feels that way sometimes!"", but... there is just no way.

I am currently ""happier"" than I have ever been in my whole life. And I am starting to implode from the pressure of maintaining the facade that I deserve anything I have. In the past few months, I have started to sabotage my relationship by drinking too much and getting into bullshit arguments with my boyfriend, who is SO AMAZING that he just tells me the next morning that he knows I am going through something right now and he wants to help me through it the best he can. I have started lying about things being done at work that aren't FOR NO REASON. Like, I could tell my boss that the things haven't even been started yet, and it would be fine. But I lie. My boss is so kind and amazing, she literally brought me presents yesterday for no reason. I have bills *that I have the money to pay* in default, and creditors are calling me every day. I ignore them. One of these bills is for $8. Eight fucking dollars. I'm paralyzed about it. I won't fix it. These are only a few aspects of my life as examples. I do not have any friends, I pushed them all away after my divorce, and I actively avoid new friendships. I mean, I have coworkers that have BEGGED me to come to parties they were having. I lie about having other plans. I deserve to have my life fucked up. I don't deserve the amazing relationships and things I have, and it's only a matter of time before everyone finds that out and takes it away from me anyway. At least if I sabotage it myself it will be on my terms.

I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am. I am elated one minute, realizing that I can start to grow now, then I am terrified I'm faking it, then I am gut-wrenchingly depressed about all of the potential time and energy and LIFE I have wasted thinking that I am a fraud, then I berate myself again for faking it... It feels like my whole world is upside down.

If you have read this far, thank you. I know that this subreddit is super small and appears to be dead, but I had to write this. The wikipedia page said that the realization that others have this syndrome is a huge part of coping with it.

This is the first day of my life. Maybe I will be brave and cross-post this, but I don't know to where. I already saved a copy of this to my boyfriend's desktop, which is braver than I was when I started typing. I feel like I'm getting braver by the minute, throwing open the windows in my mind and letting the truth stream in like the sun.

* I'm not an imposter.
* I'm not faking everything I do.
* I hope that someday soon I will believe the two sentences above this one.

**EDIT:  I ended on a happy note, then went right back to doubting myself again, and now I feel numb and exhausted.  I am concerned that if I take a nap or try to focus on anything else that I will settle back into denial, self-sabotage and believing that I am faking this, which will mean that nothing will change.  I am hoping that this post will remind me that Imposter Syndrome is real, and that I (might) have it.  Any advice is appreciated, however I think what I truly need is validation.  People telling me that it is possible I have Imposter Syndrome.  People saying that they have it, or have seen it before, and that I am exhibiting symptoms of it.  Please understand that I am not asking for a diagnosis.  It seems inevitable that (if I manage to keep myself convinced it is real) I will end up seeking psychological help eventually for this.  This is ground-zero of the truthbomb that just exploded in my head.  I just need to know that this could be real.**

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that it isn't against reddit rules for me to say that I am hoping to get as many responses as possible, given the circumstances.**  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Originally posted to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/r/ImposterSyndrome""&gt;r/ImposterSyndrome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a few minutes ago, but that sub might be dead, so I cross-posted to here.

I've gone to multiple people so far:

**.**A volunteer earning his hours which was a good start but they eventually moved on to finish their degree.

**.**Then a more professionally established doctor (PHD, LP) who I saw for six months, 1-2 sessions a week. Took a test involving figuring out as many puzzles as possible within an allotted time, pressing a button whenever I saw an 'X' on the screen, and some questionnaires. In the end, he told me I was suffering from ['Dysthymia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929) which from my understanding is a symptom and not a real cause. What turned me off from seeing him again was that he said: ""I should've noticed this sooner"".

**.**Met with a nurse practitioner for trying out meds for the first time. Looking back, I think she was more interested in pushing drugs from companies she associated with (one session she was really dressed up and explained that she was going to a dinner meeting with a pharma company which was normal apparently) than making good choices. She had me take a genetic test to see what meds may or may not work best but I don't recall ever really going over the results nor did she seem to have a better idea for what I can try. Just kept feeling like she was randomly choosing things.

**.**Was referred to someone for CBT to find out after the first session that she's retiring so she won't be around much longer. No idea why they sent me to her.

**.**Then went to an 'MA, LMFT' who was supposedly known for doing well with hypnotherapy. Ended up not doing much else besides regular talk sessions. In the end, she said I need to push through my issues and recommended I started coming in to read some book together about self-help or something along those lines which I declined and stopped going to her.

**.**Another person for trying medications again but quickly noped the fuck out when I had to ""jump-through-hoops"" to get as much info from the previous people on paper for her since she didn't like to use anything electronic. After doing that, she decided it would be best to essentially start over and re-try meds that seemed to fail in the past.

**.**Took a chance and somehow ended up trying horse therapy. It was actually a nice experience, being able to hang out with the animals which ended up having a rare moment. Unfortunately, not much else came of it all. 

She had an issue at the ranch she was keeping her horses at so we just did regular talk sessions for a bit until she let me know she was no longer working in the field and will be focusing on groups of people, helping them plan and achieve life goals. She also has some immune system issues where she can easily get sick and I think the stress of too much work got to her most of all between her horse care and working.

**.**FINALLY, I met with the Dr. who has helped me a ton with finding a medication that worked due to him properly reading the genetic test I took years back from the nurse practitioner. The first med on my recommended list worked INCREDIBLY to the point of feeling like the real me for the first time in my life. Unfortunately, it has since then stabilized (about a year worth) and now figuring out what to do next when I see him soon.

**.**While seeing the above, I started therapy sessions again with an 'MSW, LICSW' he recommended. Was OK for a couple months until recently when I got results back from a test she recommended which only proved that I most likely don't have ADHD. I was under the impression that it was completely about my learning abilities but turned out to include other emotional things. This in no form from what I can see helps me and now I get to pay a $520 medical bill for it. 

**Long story a bit longer**, I'm absolutely frustrated, angry, and a lot less hopeful after all of these years. Seems like they all mostly ended up telling me that I just need to work through everything and that there's nothing they can really do besides see me when I felt like it.

Maybe I really don't need therapy and I do need to just push through it all. But, if that's the case, I don't understand why they all seem to take that long to get to that result especially the ones who've had the notes from the previous doctors. Seems like they could have come to that conclusion a lot sooner and saved me so much money and time.

Please, I’m only here to see what your responses are simply for my own edification. 

As of writing this, I’ve been awake for 40 hours. Ten minutes ago, I took temazepam as prescribed.

I’m not tired, per se. Intellectually, I know that the body needs sleep. I know I cannot do schoolwork when I’ve been awake so long. It doesn’t take rocket science to figure out that anxiety doesn’t help mental health symptoms. So yes, the great anxiety I’m dealing with isn’t helping me. 

So I’m not tired, but my body feels heavy. I don’t feel like I can sleep but it’s hard to keep my eyes closed to relax. I am not experiencing any kind of psychosis. To be honest, all I’m doing is laying in bed watching YouTube videos, hoping to fall asleep any moment. 

I don’t feel like I need to sleep, but it’s not like I’m pacing, no pressured speech, not impulsive (at least compared to my baseline). According to my insight, no, I’m not manic. If anything, I’m depressed. 

**So, what happens to the body** when you’ve been up 18 hours, 24, 36, 48...? The longest I’ve been awake is 98 hours. **What happens then?** 

When I was up that long, the 98 hours. I didn’t have to go to the hospital. My doctor increased my ziprasidone (benztropine stayed the same) and gave me the temazepam to take as needed. It helps. I hope it works within the next five minutes or something.

Occasional insomnia has been overall controlled., happening once every four or five hours.

While visiting my in-laws around Christmas, I felt so desperate to be around people (husband works a lot) I asked if I could stay for a week or so. Being alone is awful when you're sleep deprived, in my opinion. They were generous and offered a month.

I ended up staying three weeks. While I was  there I developed a routine; PJs by 8, a certain TV show by 9, in bed by 10, melatonin at 10:30, and audiobook at 10:50. This was aided by the fact that my in-laws went to sleep early as well and are generally very calm/easygoing people. I went from 2 hours a night to 5-6 hours a night. Most nights I'd fall asleep around 11 and wake up anywhere between 4:50 and 5:50 AM. They had extra bedrooms I could switch to and a spacious living room I could sit in if I was awake. They were very welcoming in that they said I could even utilize the downstairs gym to wear myself out. I never needed it though.

While visiting my in-laws around Christmas, I felt so desperate to be around people (husband works a lot) I asked if I could stay for a week or so. Being alone is awful when you&amp;#39;re sleep deprived, in my opinion. They were generous and offered a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up staying three weeks. While I was  there I developed a routine; PJs by 8, a certain TV show by 9, in bed by 10, melatonin at 10:30, and audiobook at 10:50. This was aided by the fact that my in-laws went to sleep early as well and are generally very calm/easygoing people. I went from 2 hours a night to 5-6 hours a night. Most nights I&amp;#39;d fall asleep around 11 and wake up anywhere between 4:50 and 5:50 AM. They had extra bedrooms I could switch to and a spacious living room I could sit in if I was awake. They were very welcoming in that they said I could even utilize the downstairs gym to wear myself out. I never needed it though. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time I've had difficulty accepting myself as a mostly gay bisexual man. a couple of reasons:

1. homophobic country
2. dysfunctional family. raised by a poor single mom and no father. no male role models. 
3. depression

i can't help but think that i wasn't meant to be this way but rather heterosexual. all my life i've gotten offers and compliments from girls but due to having this huge sexuality secret, kept to myself and was highly introverted. in college now and seeing people hookup and have friends they spend time with just set off a lot within.

I keep flashing back to my childhood and can remember my adeptness at soccer but also a love for girly stuff. i played with girls cos the boys rejected me not cos i really *wanted* to. i spent all my time with my mom moving from place to place never connecting with boys. they always teased me cos of my name, my height and my lack of 'manliness'. stereotypical, i should say.

I was stoic than most and hardier in terms of resilience but was always more or less girly and less aggressive. I was the type of kid to take a beating without wavering but would never try to pick fights or throw my weight about. i was this weird mix of gentility and refinement among brutes. traits usually not found among boys.

Growing up has sucked. i'm in my early 20s now and can honestly I've been fucking depressed for ages. it's all coming to a head now cos I've tasted Grindr, I've had sexual fun but it all feels hollow and fake like it's someone else's body and world. i can't help but think that had i had a father or father figure or males around me i would have turned out straight and 'normal'. i'm angry and find it hard to disassociate from this thought cos when i look around, almost all the not straight people I've met had problems with their parents. all the people i know who are ostensibly straight have normal relationships with their folks as far as i can tell but the men I've had relations with and the few gender non-conforming girls all had one thing in common: dysfunctional relationships with their parents.

&amp;#x200B;

am i wrong in thinking that coming from a broken home screwed me up? and not just that but not having enough male figures to model myself after caused me in some way to lust after men to make up for it??

My heart was shattered to pieces when she passed away and I have been struggling with depression, insomnia, and trauma ever since.

I barely can get any sleep on most nights and I'm so tired and depressed to the point I rarely can get out of the house. I keep having flashbacks of the traumas replaying over and over again in my head, and it tears me apart every time.

I realize that I need professional help, and I'm considering medications or therapy. I'm open to trying out medications but I'm kind of terrified about going to counseling/therapy. I've never gone to therapy before and don't really know what to expect. I'm not good at opening up about my deep emotions to other people in general, and it makes me uncomfortable and nervous just thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the treatment plan typically like for complex grief? Is it effective enough with just medications, or is therapy a necessity? What can I expect from a grief counseling/therapy? What kind of medications do they typically prescribe for a case like this? Can I go to my primary physician for diagnosis?

They don't berate the child for mistakes more than others, they simply explain them as you would to an adult.  
To stress the point that they're not stern and strict parents, simply correct in their language.

Would this have any significant positive or negative influence on the child during its youth and / or later in its life?  
I'm thinking it would make it harder to connect with your child early on though it might have a positive influence on the childs verbal skillset, at the least getting them more fluent with language at an earlier age.

The basis of my question is centered around the idea of a child still making neural connections at a much higher rate than later in life.

Such that certain correct pathways are being reinforced earlier and limiting ones that need to be broken down again.  
(eg: calling a bruise or scrape a ""booboo"").

It makes sense to me, however considering it seems to be such a common phenomenon to not do this, i believe i'm missing a crucial factor here.

Tried to help. I lived in a hotel with her for a week. Finally. I brought her and her son to my parents. It's been 6 months. And after about 3 weeks to a month in she completely shut off from me. Wouldn't sleep in my bed, zero affection. We would be driving somewhere and she would just stare out her window completely distant. She constantly criticized me. Daily. And compared me under her ex's. Saying that I'm not normal, the way I act isn't normal. I'm too sensitive I need to be a normal guy again like when we met. Shifting the blame on me, twisting things so that I'm always at fault. And then... She would say I said things I don't recall saying, or that she told me things I don't remember her saying. Or did things. And at first I was like no... that wasn't said, that didn't happen. But I can have selective hearing. So part of me was thinking did I say that? Did she say that??

And it needs to be a constant thing. That I would be a terrible father, knowing that I want children. And I have 2 godchildren who I love to death. Lately the lies have been blatant and total fabrications. My mom living with us seeing this. Tried to say, she needs to go. She treats you like garbage. The relationship is completely one sided and she doesn't care about you or what your doing for her. She's going through a custody battle so always defend her, saying she's just going through alot of stress. 3 weeks ago. I was about ready to make her leave. Me and my mom were texting. She went through my phone. Saw the conversation. And now she's only around the days she has her son. Otherwise she's at her real dad's. And I know this to be true. But. I can't help but things are going on. So Friday. I see someone tagged her in a photo on FB. It was relationship themed from another man. I message this guy. Who knew nothing of me or of our relationship. And said ""I thought something about her didn't seem right, I told her I was going to quit talking to her but she wants to call me to talk about it."" Nail in the coffin for me. I called her out. And she said she can have friends. Which I didn't disagree about. but it was obvious they weren't talking like ""friends"" according to him. She also said if he asked to hang out. She would probably have said yes. I instantly tell her she can no longer stay with me. While she screamed at me calling me crazy and I'm spying and acting like a psycho. And i was telling him i said she cant take care of her children among other things, which i denied, but she had proof. She has screenshots. Now.. i know i didnt day these things. And i told her to send them to me. Which she refused. So i said i would send her the entire conversation. Which i did. She never opened it. She deleted me off of all social media. Now today she came by the house. I had her things sitting nicely for her to pick up. She placed them all back where they were originally. Even hooking her son's Xbox back up to the tv. All I said was. I hope everything between her son and court goes ok. And she said, the funny thimg about that Facebook post was it was staged, she asked him to post it. To see if I would see it and act crazy. And I did. It was her trick. And she said she would give me the dudes phone number and ask him if I didn't believe her.

Explanation:
From age 0 to 6 I lived with my parents. Bad environment, lacked care giving and attention, and my parents did drugs alot. I was adopted at 7 and stopped seeing them. 
Im just wondering if something like this at such a young age can cause any significant mental health problems in the future such as anger problems, relationship issues, etc

And if your parents did drugs around you at a young age are you more likely to become a drug abuser or can drug abuse be hereditary too ?

 then I will pass a few seconds and respond to the nonsense words that sounded like a question with a series of nonsense words that sound affirmative like an answer to a question...

Several years ago I read a Chuck Palahniuk book called Survivor, in there I came across a quote that has always stuck with me:

“The problem in this case was you can't be a middle-aged virgin in America without something being wrong with you. People can't conceive of a virtue in someone else that they can't conceive in themselves. Instead of believing you're stronger, it's so much easier to imagine you're weaker.”

Not speaking directly to the disbelief of someone being a virgin, but is there a term for this kind of willful disbelief of someone else's virtues because you can't believe that you could have that virtue?  Just as the quote implies, you can't conceive, or remain in willful disbelief that someone else could do something virtuous that you could not see yourself doing?

I've done some searching and even asked a psychologist of some 15 years of experience if there was any psychological condition or term for such a phenomenon, and came up empty handed.  I have however seen several instances where someone could not believe the best in another person simply because they couldn't believe they could ever be that way.  Almost like they think, ""That's too good to be true"" or categorize another's actions as being disingenuous, false, a show or facade, and that due to their own paradigm and seeing the world through a jaded lens.

Any thoughts?  Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I read a Chuck Palahniuk book called Survivor, in there I came across a quote that has always stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The problem in this case was you can&amp;#39;t be a middle-aged virgin in America without something being wrong with you. People can&amp;#39;t conceive of a virtue in someone else that they can&amp;#39;t conceive in themselves. Instead of believing you&amp;#39;re stronger, it&amp;#39;s so much easier to imagine you&amp;#39;re weaker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not speaking directly to the disbelief of someone being a virgin, but is there a term for this kind of willful disbelief of someone else&amp;#39;s virtues because you can&amp;#39;t believe that you could have that virtue?  Just as the quote implies, you can&amp;#39;t conceive, or remain in willful disbelief that someone else could do something virtuous that you could not see yourself doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done some searching and even asked a psychologist of some 15 years of experience if there was any psychological condition or term for such a phenomenon, and came up empty handed.

And also the wall of text. And sorry if this post is not related to this sub and mods please feel free to remove it.

In Asia culture, especially in the Sinosphere, physiognomy plays a major role and much to my own surprise I found that some claims are actually quite correct. That makes me wonder if physiognomy should be a potential real science which will be worth studying. So here are a few of my reasonings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Psychology:**

You gotta admit that physical appearances are more or less have an influence on our life. Human are attracted to beauties, it's imprinted on our minds. Studies found that an attractive person would be more likely to get a job than a less attractive person with the similar set of skills on the same job (Sorry I'm too lazy to back this up with an article). The less attractive person who's been treated like that would have their psychology affected, shaped and formed and may act a bit unethical to equalize the competition. This might explain why some physiques and facial features are interpreted with some traits. This also explains why physiognomy differs from region to region because each culture has different beauty standard. However this cannot explain why others are uniquely interpreted some specific traits which brings me to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inheritance and Stereotypes:**

The saying ""Like father, like son"" is not a bald claim without facts to back it up. Personalities are proved to be inherited both by nature and nurture alongside with physical traits. This may be the corner stone of the bootstrapping mechanism of stereotypes as these traits passes on the next generations further reinforcing those stereotypes. 

*So the question is: ""Should physiognomy be taken seriously and be researched scientifically based on facts and not just speculation?""*

These are just my two cents on the topic so I'm opened to correction for my mistakes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let me preface something first.

I'm a high schooler doing a study on impacts of social media on mental health.

Right now, I'm assuming that it's associated with validation and an identity duality.

As a person who is very interested in the differences between orientation, mental illness, paraphilia, and fetishization I became very interested in the term Gynandromorpho*philia*. More the philia portion. Where is the line between orientation and paraphilia? Is it a matter of how common it is? Is it when it goes outside of traditional gender designations? We have moved homosexuality to being an orientation but it was considered a paraphilia [Homophile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophile) as short ago as the 70's. Is that because we understand sexuality to be between people of the two genders?


Which is what leads me to “chasers”. People who are attracted to trans men/women in a fetishic way are not generally well liked. The view as I understand it is that trans individuals see chasers as checking off a “sexual bucket list”. Which some are, but that line is what I question. What is the difference between that sexual bucket list and women who want to try a man with a very large/small penis or a man who wants to date a woman with very large/small breasts? It reminds me of the issue of race fetishization, but we also know people are more likely to want to date people who look like to the same they grew up around. So a person of one race who grows up around another race dating a member of that race certainly wouldn't be fetishizing them?


Where does all this leave people who have a real and sustained sexual attraction to everything outside the two genders? Is the concept of sexual orientation too focused on the binary even as more and more research emerges that the functional things about orientation, that it is hard wired, and unchangeable, exist in more dimensions than genders.

For instance, we all know this list is apt to change over time, but as we currently have it -- here's the list of 10 personality disorders from DSM-V: 

\-------------------**Cluster A**

**•** Schizoid 

• Schizotypal 

• Paranoid 

\-------------------**Cluster B**

• Narcissistic 

• Histrionic 

• Antisocial 

• Borderline 

\-------------------**Cluster C**

**•** Avoidant 

• Obsessive Compulsive 

• Dependent 

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to put a loose guess out here, I would initially assume that Narcissistic PD, Antisocial PD, Histrionic PD, Obsessive Compulsive PD and Schizoid PD “feel” pretty secure about their own intentions and identity (their disposition tends to feel “in the right” regarding their thoughts and intentions and how they actively obtain their needs). They feel either above others, or in the case of Schizoid, not in need of others. 

However, the following seem to have more potential to have unpleasant experiences as a result of their dispositions: 

• Dependent PDs typically end up in abusive relationships over and over and they feel like they have to put up with the treatment because they feel unable to care for themselves (DPD attracts NPD).  

• Paranoid PDs believe the world is out to get them, therefore they’re constantly on guard and hyper-vigilant about self protection (and while they definitely seem to feel as though their world-lense is correct, this constant fearful watching cannot be very pleasant)

• Avoidant PDs tend to avoid interpersonal relationships due to fear of rejection, yet (unlike Schizoid) crave to be able to attain more safe social interactions. 

• Borderline PD individuals seem like they can either feel, at times, an extreme high about the self and others, or at other times an extreme low about the self and others

It's interesting to surmise the connections here. Would love to hear other perspectives on this.

Basically, this refers to a sense of intense emptiness and meaninglessness after finishing an emotionally engaging work of fiction, whether it be a western TV series, anime, movie, videogame, or even a novel. Normally, there is a slight sense of emptiness and poignancy after finishing an immersing work of fiction, but this takes that further. People afflicted seem to become extremely emotionally invested into these fictional characters and are upset when they finish the show because they miss the characters, like actually people who have left their lives.

This is one of the main factors in the broadly used big 5 personality model.

&amp;#x200B;

However, openness seems to be broken up into two parts in other models: openness to experience and openness to ideas. This shows up in the big 5 aspect scale for example, which splits openness up in to ""intellect"" and ""open to experience"". I'm having difficulty understanding what openness to experience \*is\*. It is easy to describe what someone open to experience \*does\*, but it's harder to describe mechanically what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

A common analogy for ideas is that of the meme (which showed up in Dawkins the selfish gene). You have a somewhat related idea of the schema in psychology.  This means one way of understanding openness to ideas is that memes or ideas readily enter your brain and sort of move through it. That is a bit too ""poetic"". I get the idea means that an idea will stick in your head and then sort of ""get applied / related"" to other ideas. So for example you might learn about group theory in maths and then start trying to understand how things around you are groups (That toggle switch is a group with two elements, that circular table is the symmetry group of a circle which is the same as real numbers modular one. How might I turn the rooms of my house into a group etc etc etc).

&amp;#x200B;

What might the analogy of a ""meme"" be for openness to experience? Is there an analogy of experiences merging like you can sort of ""merge"" together ideas? Is there some sort of ""abstraction"" of an experience like their the abstraction of ideas. Is it different if you find out the common aspects of two experiences to if you pull out common aspects of an idea? Is there any evidence that this sort of ""unit of experience"" exists in the brain?

&amp;#x200B;

I fear there might be limited research on the topic.. but one can hope.

As an aside I think whatever this unit of experience is it shows up in fiction books.

Part of the reason must be the time-lapse between decision and usage, and another part must be that the objective foundations of people's desires (e.g. hormone levels, neural structures) do change.

Is there, or could there someday be, a possible purchasing mechanism that bypasses human psychology, or at least its most vulnerable features?

This example may seem pretty niche, but in the coming age of artificial intelligence, there's no reason to consider it unworthy of any attention.) But I think the best answer would be to find a new medium of exchange that ties the objective bases for desire more directly to the decision to purchase, bypassing the fancies of human impulse. It would probably not take a tangible form, since anything tangible invites the conscious attention, and bias therewith. 

There are features of existing currency that skew people's financial decisions, like weight/value and number/value ratios (e.g. deeming small change relatively worthless), but maybe if currency took a different form and an altered function such biases would pale in comparison to what we could obviate.

I was in a lecture today, and since people were preparing for a difficult exam and applying for internships we were all pretty stressed out and under pressure ,the professor decided to tell us a few stories about different people in his life who had potential but let stress and fear get in the way, usually I don't think about the stories we're told in class, but this one peaked my interest, due to it involving the psychology of people that want to succeed but sabotage themselves. He said that one of the people he knew was a biochemistry student who wanted to succeed in his work/field and be given more leadership opportunities in projects he was apparently one of the best/most organised students in that year group, he was good at managing himself, tutoring others occasionally, and even gave ideas to lecturers about changes people would like. However, as soon as he got a leadership position, he would be riddled with self doubt about his judgements,  thinking about everything that could go wrong, such as people trusting him and him letting them down, eventually he made mistakes he wouldn't usually make, spread out power that he should have had, and the team began to lose faith in him, despite him having the potential. 

The professor then went on to talk about one of his friends who he graduated with and how he was able to get a job at a good corporate company, which paid him well enough to live comfortably in the UK, however he struggled with his relationships; he wasn't too bad looking, could talk to most people, was funny and was interested in a breadth of things such as philosophy, eastern religions, and archery etc, he wouldn't have issues with dating, but once things got serious and showed potential, his mind would start playing negative scenarios on repeat, and thoughts such as  what if we get bored ?, what if they don't feel the same in a few years ?, what could end the relationship?, or what if they think I am someone I am not ? almost as if he would be stressed out about things that could go wrong, and this would cause him to bring those things into reality and do things that could ruin the relationship, which would then cut the relationship shorter than it had the potential to be. 

He then finished by telling us the story of his son ( who is a grown man by now, but was a teen in this story), and how he was a quiet but not shy young man, he would have no issues observable issues talking to other people, but would never really talk to them again or have a relationship with them, he would have friends, but most of the effort came from the side of the friends, he talked to his dad about this and it was the same pattern, he wouldn't necessarily stress out about talking to other people, but he would also think about how he could gain a few new friends only to lose them, or do something bad to them, so unconsciously he would do things to stop the relationships from getting to the point where they could let down, or stop the conflict. 

The professor said all of these people had a lot of potential to achieve the success they wanted, but it was something about their thinking and psychology, that made them fear the success, their fear caused them to sabotage themselves, sometimes in ways that they didn't even understand themselves, they allowed stress to get to them, despite having the abilities needed to achieve what they wanted, I understand the moral of the stories, but can anyone explain the root cause of this type of thinking ? and how it can be handled ?

I ask because the importance of a ""contract"", ""IF A THEN B"" seems pretty critical to incentivize, or disincentivize, certain behaviors, and I'm just interested in when such skills are required.

That made me think, the Milgram's sound recordings obviously were those of actors. Would there have been a difference in results if the recordings were genuine? Maybe consciously it is much easier to obey pressing those buttons if there is some degree of disbelief or an ""authenticity sensor""?

Also, Joe is not real, but just a computer simulation which behaves in the same way he would. The code doesn’t know this isn’t the real world. I don’t know if this is important. 

Anyway, after reading a thread on /r/AskReddit, where in the comments some people were talking about getting stuck in solidary confinement for ~10 days. They said that it took them 2-4 days to start going insane, and even after days of getting out still couldn’t understand what was happening around them. One guy mentionned that his friend was in SC for 60 days and was never the same after getting out. One difference between these rooms and Joe’s is that solidary confinement does not have anything to do with only walls around you, with maybe a single book (based on movies, correct me if this is innacurate), whereas Joe had a standard kitchen, possibly even a whole house, at his disposal. I’m also guessing the atmosphere is vastly different. 

This reminded me of the above-mentionned scene of the show, during which I remeber thinking that it seems like an abnormally cruel punishment. 

Doing the math, Joe will spend roughly 1.2 billion years stuck in this room, assuming it’s a standard 2 week holiday

The song gets louder everytime he breaks the radio where it’s playing from. Will these factors this make it worse?)

Obviously, we’re assuming that Joe’s immortal in this case (I don’t think they disclosed that in the episode itself). What is likely to happen to Joe’s mental health, and could he ever get back to his normal self, after potential billions of years of therapy?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify, that is not exactly what happened, but the main idea still stands. Also, Joe is not real, but just a computer simulation which behaves in the same way he would. The code doesn’t know this isn’t the real world. I don’t know if this is important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after reading a thread on &lt;a href=""/r/AskReddit""&gt;/r/AskReddit&lt;/a&gt;, where in the comments some people were talking about getting stuck in solidary confinement for ~10 days. They said that it took them 2-4 days to start going insane, and even after days of getting out still couldn’t understand what was happening around them. One guy mentionned that his friend was in SC for 60 days and was never the same after getting out. One difference between these rooms and Joe’s is that solidary confinement does not have anything to do with only walls around you, with maybe a single book (based on movies, correct me if this is innacurate), whereas Joe had a standard kitchen, possibly even a whole house, at his disposal. I’m also guessing the atmosphere is vastly different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of the above-mentionned scene of the show, during which I remeber thinking that it seems like an abnormally cruel punishment. &lt;/p&gt;

Also, is &amp;quot;feeling good&amp;quot; considered internal or external. If I do something because it makes me feel good, then I am not doing it for its own sake, but at the same time &amp;quot;feeling good&amp;quot; is something internal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone might be able to help me clear this up. If people knlw about good (scientific) articles on the subject, that would be great! &lt;/p&gt;

5. Animal subjects: How often do you conduct animal tests? Are you ever made to do things with animal subjects that morally don't sit well with you, and if so, is there any recourse available for concerns?
6. If you were not on another person's plan, how did you deal with health insurance while in school?
7. How extensive is the math involved with research? Do you ever feel like you are more of a mathematician than a psychologist? As somebody who dislikes intense math, this is a concern of mine.
8. How would you compare your enthusiasm at the beginning of your career to now? Does it feel like a grind?
9. During graduate schooling, did it feel like your life was on hold for your education, or were you able to find a balance between school, relationships, and work? If the former, was it worth it for what you have now? Because of my age I am afraid that it will be a mistake to start a 10 year degree.

It's a word everybody uses all the time, so everybody has an idea of what it means, but I couldn't find any real definition of it. 

It obviously has something to do people's behavior, and specifically, the regularities in their behavior. Someone who often behaves extroverted is said to have an extroverted personality, someone who's often quiet is said to have an introverted or shy personality. However, people often behave very differently depending on the situation they're in. For example, I behave one way when I'm at work, but I behave very differently when I'm with my girlfriend, yet we still say this is all part of the same personality. So does this mean that personality is simply defined as the aggregation of all of our behavior? Or all the regularities in this behavior? 

I just read in a different thread that most psychologists don't believe multiple personality disorder exist, but if personality is the aggregate of all your behavior, then isn't this true by definition? How could it even be true in principle that someone has multiple personalities?

Another thing is that most people think that our personality is something which is 'within' us. We have a personality, which we always carry with is, and this personality causes our behavior. But our behavior is also greatly dependant on the context. If I were locked up in a basement tomorrow, then my behavior would change greatly, yet most people wouldn't say this meant my personality had changed. So does this mean there's still a difference between behavior/patterns of behavior and personality? Behavior would be (partially) caused by our personality but it's not the same?

So recently i've been trying to figure out whether or not I want to pursue a career in psychology and psychiatry afterwards. My biggest passion is learning about mind, human behavior and why we do things the way we do. I've resisted the idea of going to school for psychology and chose art instead, but I realize videography isn't really feeding my soul. I enjoy listening to people, hearing their problems and then if I can, offering a solution. Number of my friends have told me that i'm their best psychologist and I'm wasting my time by not pursuing the career.

However, since it's such a long-term commitment, I want to make sure that I will absolutely be enjoying my job and will have no regrets. To test waters, I was thinking maybe I could somehow consult people online (in person too if possible) and just have them talk to me about their issues. Now don't confuse this for me trying to give them any medical or professional advice. Sometimes people just want to talk about why they're sad and they already feel much better by having someone genuinely listen to them. Also, what I'd get from this process is the small experience of having a ""patient"" talk to me and see how I feel about it. Maybe I wont enjoy it at all, maybe i'll apply to the university the next day.

What I'm trying to figure out is where do I find such people and how would I prove myself safe/worthy of being opened up to? Where do I offer this support and actually have someone interested in it? Which platform would be the best tool for such communication? I can't imagine doing it through facebook or instagram or even email. I guess replying to people's issues on reddit could also work, but I want to have this private 1 on 1 platform to kinda experience the ""therapy"" setting.

In others like English, it forms a blended single sound -- ""tra"" = ""chra"", ""dra"" = ""jra"", etc. The only difference I can tell between how these two sounds are formed is that ""tra"" is at the front of the mouth, and has a lighter tone to it, and ""dra"" is more in the middle-back of the mouth and has a deeper more tired sound.

My wife and I have discussed it, but idk if it is really necessary at this point.  I think therapy can be amazing, but I am having a tough time deciding if we are over-reacting to ""typical"" kid stuff or if there are larger issues present.  

The big issues are - 

1.  He is supposed to wear his glasses for distance work - reading off the board, etc... but not for computer or reading/spelling work.  He simply refuses to wear them at school and believes the class will make fun of him (they won't).  He wears the glasses full time at home and out in public with us, birthday parties, etc... but the school won't ""force"" him to wear them and he won't do it voluntarily.   He maintains straight A's and is in the gifted program so while it is a horrible choice, it isn't impacting him aside from our families constant bickering over it.

2.  He is frustratingly stubborn at times.  He plays soccer and the city tournament starts this week.  He is ok in the field but a great goalie.  The coach told us he wants our kid to play goalie the whole game so they have a chance at winning. My kid, while good at it, hates being goalie, and has told us he will let shots in, etc... so he never has to do it again and he hopes they lose.  Once the game starts, I don't think any of this will be true, but the idea that he would verbalize it or have these feelings is bizarre to me.  I think it is just his way of expressing displeasure at the situation but it comes out sounding douchey.  

3.  He has some anxiety about new things but it hasn't stopped him so far.  For example - new basketball team last fall he was really nervous for the first practice.  Enough that he said he didn't want to go.  We took him and within 5 minutes he was happy as could be playing and never looked back for the whole season.  This seems like pretty normal kid stuff, but I don't know.  The school, to my knowledge, hasn't mentioned any issues with him performing or reading in front of the class, etc... it is mostly new experiences and comes up rarely and with a little gentle nudging it has always been ok within 5 minutes of starting....

I don't want to start down a path that I don't know where it will lead or to validate feelings that are just being said, but not meant, etc...  I think he will use this as  a scapegoat to not do things he doesn't want to do....although maybe that is an issue in itself or something I made up.

Aren't feelings of detachment and anger symptoms of trauma or ptsd?

I even read Edward Bernay's book Propaganda. Seems to me he is the father of public relations and advertisements. And Edward Bernay used Sigmund Freud's theories.

How do experts feel about Advertisements that seem to misinform rather than inform?

How do experts feel about working with Political Campaigns, Marketing or anything like that?  Because I figure, that wealthy people would want to hire experts of psychology.

Is Marketing a form of Psychology? 

And how do experts feel about the morality of it? It seems to be a very fine line.

I have read the book and the watched all the movies. While at times I'm almost sure Michael Corlone is a psychopath, there are one or two things that seem to contradict that which makes me question if I'm right after all. Some traits which could be considered psychopathic:

1. He does depict that superficial boyish charm, both in the books and movies - but also gets really really cold at people he's known for years. Even Tom Hagen who loves him dearly and has been loyal for years gets removed from consigliere without batting an eye. 
2. Soldiers who return from war show a lot of changes in personality, and suffer post-trauma - but Michael Corleone seems to come back to his sister's wedding and enjoy his time without batting an eye.
3. While he does respect his father a lot, he doesn't seem to love anyone. He does not carry the affection and warmth of his father to keep a family together. Situations might have thrown him into the life of the mafia, and he tries to be like his father at times - he is very different. Couldn't be better or worse - just different. 
4. One of the biggest factors, I think, is his relationship with Kay. As soon as he reaches Italy, he marries Appolonia. And in the books, it's clearly stated how he looks at her more of like a possession than a partner. Something he has won. After her death, he comes back and asks Kay to marry her. It's pretty clear from get go that there is no love in that relationship. He wants her to make a family. To increase his influence as a mafia man. He makes her believe that the family is going to be legit very soon and builds a castle in the sand just to get her to marry him. 
5. He has remorselessly murdered many people, including the husband of his sister, and his own brother. 

And despite all these points, he might NOT be a psychopath as soon as we factor in the third movie - where his character takes a complete turn. He begins to care for his family, regrets killing his brother and also has his sister by the side. But the point should be noted that the third movie was forced by the studio, and the F. Coppola didn't want to shell out a trilogy. Plus, the third movie is nowhere related to the book. So if we set the aside, is Michael Corleone a full-on psychopath? Or maybe somewhere on the spectrum? Do share your opinion. I'd greatly appreciate an expert in the topic to speak on this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really confused in this regard.
