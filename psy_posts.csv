The updated rules are as follows:

1. **Do not ask for diagnostic or analytic impressions.** It is unethical to give diagnoses or analyses over the internet. These types of questions are better asked of a therapist in\-person. 
2. **Questions must be asked clearly in the post title.** Violations of this rule will be removed immediately. You may give additional or clarifying information in the body of your post.
3. **Answers must be evidence\-based.** Answers given must reflect the scientific consensus and ideally should cite sources. Anecdotal evidence or pop\-psychology will be removed.
4. **No leading questions.**  Examples of these questions are: ""Why is Group X so stupid?"" or ""What is wrong with Group X?"" 
5. **No jokes, memes, insults, or slurs.**  This is an academic subreddit, and while discussion is encouraged, any  off\-topic or non\-academic comments will be removed. This includes the  use of slang terms or slurs to describe any phenomenon or group of  people. 

Removal of posts and comments is at the sole discretion of the moderation team.
